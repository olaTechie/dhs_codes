AB  - Background: Tumor hypoxia measured by dedicated tracers like [ 18F]fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) is a well-established prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) treated with definitive chemoradiation (CRT). However, prevalence and characteristics of positron emission tomography (PET) measured hypoxia in patients with relapse after previous irradiation is missing. Here we report imaging findings of a prospective pilot study in HNSCC patients treated with re-irradiation. Method(s): In 8 patients with recurrent HNSCC, diagnosed at a median of 18 months after initial radiotherapy/CRT, [ 18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT (n=8) and FMISO-PET/MRI (n=7) or FMISO-PET/CT (n=1) were performed. Static FMISO-PET was performed after 180 min. MRI sequences in PET/MRI included diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and contrast enhanced T1w imaging (StarVIBE). Lesions (primary tumor recurrence, 4; cervical lymph node, 1; both, 3) were delineated on FDG-PET and FMISO-PET data using a background-adapted threshold-based method. SUV max and SUV mean in FDG- and FMISO-PET were derived, as well as maximum tumor-to-muscle ratio (TMR max) and hypoxic volume with 1.6-fold muscle SUV mean (HV 1.6) in FMISO-PET. Intensity of lesional contrast enhancement was rated relative to contralateral normal tissue. Average ADC values were derived from a 2D region of interest in the tumor. Result(s): In FMISO-PET, median TMR max was 1.7 (range: 1.1-1.8). Median HV 1.6 was 0.05 ml (range: 0-7.3 ml). Only in 2/8 patients, HV 1.6 was >=1.0 ml. In FDG-PET, median SUV max was 9.3 (range: 5.0-20.1). On contrast enhanced imaging four lesions showed decreased and four lesions increased contrast enhancement compared to non-pathologic reference tissue. Median average ADC was 1,060 x10 6 mm 2/s (range: 840-1,400 x10 6 mm 2/s). Conclusion(s): This pilot study implies that hypoxia detectable by FMISO-PET may not be as prevalent as expected among loco-regional recurrent, HPV negative HNSCC. ADC values were only mildly reduced, and contrast enhancement was variable. The results require confirmation in larger sample sizes.Copyright © 2021 Rogasch J et al.

AB  - Purpose: Tumor hypoxia impairs the response of head-and-neck cancer (HNSCC) patients to radiotherapy and can be detected both by tissue biomarkers and PET imaging. However, the value of hypoxia biomarkers and imaging for predicting HNSCC patient outcomes are incompletely understood, and potential correlations between tissue and PET data remain to be elucidated. Here, we performed exploratory analyses of potential correlations between tissue-based hypoxia biomarkers and longitudinal hypoxia imaging in a prospective trial of HNSCC patients. Method(s): Forty-nine patients undergoing chemoradiation for locally advanced HNSCCs were enrolled in this prospective trial. They underwent baseline biopsies and [18F]FDG PET imaging and [18F]FMISO PET at weeks 0, 2, and 5 during treatment. Immunohistochemical analyses for p16, Ki67, CD34, HIF1alpha, CAIX, Ku80, and CD44 were performed, and HPV status was assessed. Biomarker expression was correlated with biological imaging information and patient outcome data. Result(s): High HIF1alpha tumor levels significantly correlated with increased tumor hypoxia at week 2 as assessed by the difference in the [18F]FMISO tumor-to-background ratios, and high HIF1alpha and CAIX expressions were both associated with a deferred decrease in hypoxia between weeks 2 and 5. Loco-regional recurrence rates after radiotherapy were significantly higher in patients with high CAIX expression and also increased for high levels of the DNA repair factor Ku80. HPV status did not correlate with any of the tested hypoxia biomarkers, and HPV-positive patients showed higher loco-regional control rates and progression-free survival independent of their hypoxia dynamics. Conclusion(s): In this exploratory trial, high expression of the tissue-based hypoxia biomarkers HIF1alpha and CAIX correlated with adverse hypoxia dynamics in HNSCCs during chemoradiation as assessed by PET imaging, and high CAIX levels were associated with increased loco-regional recurrence rates. Hence, hypoxia biomarkers warrant further investigations as potential predictors of hypoxia dynamics and hypoxia-associated radiation resistance.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Since 01/01/2020, the cervical cancer screening in Germany has been carried out due to the organized early cancer diagnosis guideline (oKFE-RL). In 2007, HPV vaccination was initiated in Germany. The main goal of both initiatives is to further reduce the incidence of invasive cervical cancer. To assess the effect of the new screening strategy in a timely manner, monitoring of short-term changes need to be considered. Ideally, the effects of both prevention methods would be presented together in one model. Material(s) and Method(s): Because no change in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer is initially expected, the incidence of CIN 3 is used as a surrogate parameter to assess the effects of the prevention efforts. Based on expected additional effects of vaccination and co-testing, a model-based estimation of the expected CIN 3 incidence during the evaluation of the screening program is performed using the CIN 3 incidence in the Saarland population. Modeling results: The oKFE-RL provides for two groups: Primary cytodiagnosis continues until 35 years of age. Here, in the next few years, CIN 3 incidence will be reduced not by the oKFE-RL but by the increasing proportion of vaccinated women. In the group over 35 years, co-testing was introduced with a stringent algorithm. Due to the higher sensitivity of the HPV test, significantly more CIN 3 are detected in the first round of 3 years and thus, the CIN 3 incidence initially increases. As these CIN 3 are absent in the second round, significantly fewer CIN 3 cases will be detected then. These effects suggest a global decrease in CIN 3 incidence of 25.8% after 6 years. Conclusion(s): Observation of the age distribution curve of CIN 3 allows both effects of prevention to be assessed in a timely manner and separately. In the future, data from epidemiologic cancer registries should be incorporated into the model to replace modeling with real data.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the clinical efficiency of quadrivalent HPV (types 6/11/16/18) vaccine in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). This was a prospective study of patients with RRP treated from January 2009 to July 2012 at the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of the Emergency County Hospital of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Demographic characteristics, onset of RRP, HPV typing, use and number of cidofovir injections, number of surgeries for RRP per year, and use of human papillomavirus vaccine (types 6, 11, 16, 18) (recombinant, adsorbed)/Silgard were considered from all the patients included in the study. Charts were reviewed for follow-up after diagnosis, after cidofovir, and after Silgard; all the statistical tests were applied at a significance level of 5 %. The recurrences were observed within 27.53 +/- 11.24 days after intralesional cidofovir injection. Thirteen patients with recurrence after cidofovir agreed and received Silgard vaccine. 85 % [54.44-99.41] of patients had no recurrences during 1-year follow-up. The recurrence of papillomas was observed in two patients (15 %, 95 % CI [0.59-45.56]), one with adult-onset RRP and one with juvenile-onset RRP. Both recurrences appeared after the first Silgard dose; one month after the third vaccine dose each patient underwent a new surgery for remaining papillomas with no recurrences at 1-year follow-up visit. Silgard vaccination had a good effect and proved to be efficient in the treatment of our patients with RRR without appearance of recurrence in 85 % of the patients during 1-year follow-up. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - PURPOSE Currently available human papillomavirus (HPV) detection devices are expensive, requiring a continuous power supply, high-priced reagents, skilled laboratory personnel, and infrastructure. These make it difficult to implement primary HPV screening in high-risk (HR) populations, particularly in low-income settings such as in India. The objective of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a point-of-care, portable, battery-operated device called Truenat, which detects 4 HR HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, and 45), as a potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional HPV diagnostic tests. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a single-site, blinded, cross-sectional study that evaluated the performance of the Trunat HPV-HR using cervical samples collected from nonpregnant women. 30 years old via consecutive sampling. The comparison was conducted against the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) method. All the positive samples were validated by 14 Real-TM Quant Kit. RESULTS Of 615 cervical samples, the HR-HPV DNA test was positive in 78 women (12.7%) by HC2 and in 49 (8%) by Truenat. With the consideration of limited genotype inclusivity, the sensitivity and specificity of Truenat HPV-HR were 97.7% and 98.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION The performance of Truenat HPV-HR test was comparable to that of HC2 in the 4 HPV genotypes and would be appropriate to consider for use in primary HR cervical cancer screening and particularly in low-income settings.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - Background: In contrast to adults, only limited data are available on the human papillomavirus (HPV)-type spectrum in anogenital warts (AGW) of children. Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate the HPV-type spectrum in AGW of prepubertal children. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective German multicentre study, HPV genotyping was performed in AGW biopsies of 55 1- to 12-year-old children using HPV group-specific PCRs followed by hybridization with type-specific probes or sequence analysis. Result(s): Human papillomavirus-DNA was found in 53 of the 55 AGW. In 58.5% (31/53) of the HPV-positive AGW, mucosal HPV types were detected. HPV6 (27/53, 50.9%) was the predominant type. 43.4% (23/53) of the lesions were induced by cutaneous HPV types (HPV2, HPV27, HPV57). Mucosal HPV types were significantly more common in children under 5 years of age than in children 5 years of age and older (22/25, 88.0% [95% CI: 70.0-95.8] vs. 9/28, 32.1% [95% CI: 17.9-50.7], P < 0.001). In contrast, cutaneous HPV types were significantly more prevalent in the 5- to 12-year age group (4/25, 16.0% [95% CI 6.4-34.7] vs. 19/28, 67.9% [95% CI 49.3-82.1], P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Anogenital warts in 5- to 12-year-old children are frequently associated with cutaneous HPV types, possibly due to horizontal transmission. HPV typing, in addition to comprehensive clinical and psychosocial evaluation, can potentially help in the assessment of these cases.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Although identification of human papilloma virus (HPV) status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is essential in predicting treatment response, no imaging modality can currently determine whether a tumor is HPV-related. In this retrospective study, 26 patients with OPSCC confined to the lateral wall or the base of tongue underwent neck magnetic resonance imaging, using T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in a region of interest covering the largest available primary tumor area of OPSCC on a single slice of the ADC map were calculated using two b values (0 and 1,000 s/mm(2)). Mean and minimum ADCs were compared with HPV status, using p16 immunohistochemistry as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Mean and minimum ADCs for HPV(+) OPSCC were significantly lower than those for HPV(-) OPSCC. A cut-off value of mean ADC for HPV(+) OPSCC of 1.027 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s yielded sensitivity and specificity of 83.33 and 78.57%, respectively. In conclusion, the present study indicates that ADC could be used to predict HPV status in patients with OPSCC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether radiologic extranodal extension (ENE) appearing on pretreatment CT and MRI could predict the prognosis in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population was obtained from a historical cohort diagnosed with HPV-related OPSCC. A total of 134 OPSCC patients who had a metastatic lymph node on pretreatment CT or MRI were included, and radiologic ENE was evaluated by two experienced head and neck radiologists. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of radiologic ENE on progression-free survival (PFS). The diagnostic performance of CT and MRI for the diagnosis of ENE was also evaluated in patients who underwent neck dissection. RESULTS: Seventy patients (52.2%) showed radiologic ENE-positive findings. Although patients showing radiologic ENE had a worse 3-year PFS (83.7% vs. 95.3%, p = 0.023), the association between radiologic ENE and PFS was not statistically significant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.141; hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-9.97). CT or MRI had a sensitivity of 62%, specificity of 77.8%, and accuracy of 71.9% for predicting pathologic ENE. CONCLUSION: Radiologic ENE on CT or MRI did not predict poor PFS in patients with HPV-related OPSCC, although there was a trend towards worse PFS. Further studies are warranted to determine whether radiologic ENE is a useful imaging biomarker to risk-stratify patients with HPV-related OPSCC.

AB  - Background. The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer is well established, and cervical cancer can be prevented through HPV vaccination. Little has been reported on the association between HPV and breast carcinoma (BC) or oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in Africa. It is possible that use of appropriate HPV vaccines against genotypes responsible for these cancers may also prevent their development. Objectives. To investigate HPV genotype prevalence in BC and OSCC patients in Pretoria, South Africa (SA). Methods. A retrospective cross-sectional study of BC and OSCC patients managed at Steve Biko Academic Hospital from 2015 to 2019 was undertaken. Patient medical records were analysed, and DNA was extracted from their archived pathology material and amplified by polymerase chain reaction before hybridisation for HPV genotypes. Results. There were 101 patients with BC and 50 with OSCC. The prevalence of HPV infection in BC patients was 77.2%, with 35.6% high- risk (HR) genotypes, and that in OSCC patients 90.0%, with 56.0% HR genotypes. The most prevalent HPV genotypes (>20% each) were HPV 16, 70 and 51 for BC and HPV 51, 70, 16 and 82 for OSCC, with 31.7% and 60.0% of patients, respectively, having co-infection with >=2 genotypes. Conclusion. The high prevalence of infection with multiple HPV genotypes in BC and OSCC patients, with HPV 16, 51, 70, 35 and 82 the most common genotypes in these cancers, warrants expansion of the current SA bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine for girls to include boys, and inclusion of HPV 51, 70, 35 and 82, in order to prevent BC and OSCC as well as cervical cancer.Copyright © 2023 South African Medical Association.

AB  - Recently, an increasing incidence of HPV-induced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has been observed. Moreover, locoregionally advanced stages require a combined modal approach, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, it is essential to find early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. DNA methylation changes play a crucial role in the process of carcinogenesis and are often investigated as promising biomarkers in many types of cancer. For analysis of DNA methylation levels of selected tumour suppressor genes in HPV-positive and HPV-negative samples (including primary tumours and corresponding metastases of metastasizing OPSCCs, primary tumours of non-metastasizing OPSCCs, and control samples), methylation-specific MLPA and methylation-specific high-resolution melting analyses were used. A significant difference in methylation between OPSCCs and the control group was observed in WT1, PAX6 (P < 0.01) and CADM1, RARbeta (P < 0.05) genes. CADM1 and WT1 hypermethylation was detected mostly in HPV-positive samples; all but one HPV-negative samples were unmethylated. Moreover, hypermethylation of PAX5 gene was observed in metastases compared with control samples and was also associated with shorter overall survival of all patients (P < 0.05). Associations described herein between promoter methylation of selected genes and clinicopathological data could benefit OPSCC patients in the future by improvement in screening, early detection, and prognosis of the disease.Copyright © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis for discriminating human papillomavirus (HPV) status in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in the primary tumours and metastatic lymph nodes. METHODS: Ninety-five patients with primary tumour and 91 with metastatic lymph nodes with confirmed HPV status, who underwent pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), were included as the discovery population. CT texture analysis was performed using commercially available software. Differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups were analysed using the chi(2) test (or Mann-Whitney U test) and independent t test (or Fisher's exact test). ROC curve analysis was performed to discriminate HPV status according to heterogeneity parameters. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in the separate validation population (n = 36) from an outside hospital. RESULTS: HPV positivity was 52.6% for primary tumours and 56.0% for metastatic lymph nodes. The entropy and standard deviation (SD) values in the HPV-positive group were significantly lower. Entropy using the medium filter was the best discriminator between HPV-positive and HPV-negative primary OPSCCs (AUC, 0.85) and SD without the filter for metastatic lymph nodes (AUC, 0.82). Diagnostic accuracy of entropy for the primary tumour was 80.0% in the discovery group and 75.0% in the validation group. In cases of metastatic lymph node, the accuracy of SD was 79.1% and 78.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Significant differences were found in heterogeneity parameters from texture analysis of pretreatment CECT, according to HPV status. Texture analysis could be used as an adjunctive tool for diagnosis of HPV status in clinical practice.

AB  - Thermal ablation is a point-of-care ablative treatment technique for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, limited information is available about its efficacy in low- and middle-income countries. We evaluated the efficacy of thermal ablation in treatment of CIN detected through high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in China. Women positive on high-risk HPV and having colposcopically suspected lesions eligible for ablation underwent colposcopy, biopsy and thermal ablation in one visit. Women ineligible were recalled for large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ) when histopathology results were high-grade CIN. Posttreatment follow-up at 6 months or more was with HPV test and cytology followed by colposcopy and biopsy for HPV and/or cytology-positive women. Cure was defined as either negative cytology and HPV test or absence of histopathology proved CIN in any positive women. Of total 218 HPV-positive women treated with thermal ablation (n = 170) or LLETZ (n = 48), 196 reported for follow-up evaluation. For women with histologically confirmed CIN at baseline (thermal ablation-104; LLETZ-38), cure rates were 84.6% for thermal ablation and 86.8% for LLETZ. Cure rates after thermal ablation were 90.3% for CIN grade one (CIN1) and 76.2% for CIN grade two or worse (CIN2+). HPV clearance rate was 80.4% in women undergoing thermal ablation, which was lower for HPV16/18 compared to other oncogenic types (67.6% vs 85.7%). HPV test had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.7% to detect CIN2+ at follow-up and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 40.4%. Thermal ablation is effective to treat CIN as well as to clear the high-risk HPV infection. HPV test has high PPV and NPV in following up patients posttreatment.Copyright © 2020 Union for International Cancer Control

AB  - Pathogenic microbes may colonize the female genital tract via sexual transmission and cause health issues like inflammation or malignancy, summarized as sexually transmitted disease (STD). A major representative of such pathogens is Trichomonas vaginalis (T.v.), whose role in the etiology of cervical cancer remains elusive. Traditional morphologic screening of cervical smears is able to detect T.v., although its identification may be complicated by look-alikes such as degenerated granulocytes and basal cells. In addition, the parasite's endosymbiont Mycoplasma hominis (M.h.) cannot be detected in the Pap test. This investigation was aimed at designing a PCR-based method to detect specific pathogenic germs by using cervical cytology slides to overcome morphologic uncertainty and increase diagnostic accuracy. To test our molecular screening method on T.v., M.h., and HPV in archival smears, we elaborated a multiplex PCR approach based on microdissection. This assay was applied to a minute quantity of starting material which harbored or was suspected to harbor T.v.; the resulting isolated DNA was used for subsequent molecular analyses of T.v., M.h., and HPV. We clarified the diagnosis of genital T.v. infection in 88 and 1.8% of morphologically suspicious and T.v.-negative cases, respectively. We also revealed a tendency of M.h. co-infection in high-risk HPV cases. In conclusion, a microdissection-based approach to detect pathogenic microbes such as T.v., HPV, and M.h. is a molecular tool easy to implement and may help to better understand the interactivity of these germs with respect to pathogenesis.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Benign, premalignant and malignant changes in the anogenital region, as in the oropharynx are often affected by a persistent HPV infection. Since a causal therapy isn't possible, the focus is on early diagnosis of dysplasia. Better knowledge of the human papilloma virus led to the development of the HPV vaccine and now primary prevention of cancer is possible. These findings will also influence the German cervical cancer screening. Objective(s): This article illustrates prevalence, significance, diagnostics, treatment and prevention of HPV infection and HPV-associated diseases in women. Material(s) and Method(s): A literature research under pubmed.de has been carried out. In addition up-to-date guidelines and internet-based sources were considered. Result(s): Persistent infection can lead to dysplasia and carcinoma of the cervix, vagina and vulva, the anus and the oropharynx. In future an additional HPV testing is planned to be integrated in the German screening for cervical cancer for women above 35 years. Management of dysplasia is operative or topical. Accordingly, a primary prevention through vaccination is even more important. The German Standing Vaccination Committee recommends the vaccination for girls and boys between 9 to 14 years. Conclusion(s): HPV vaccination is a secure and efficient procedure to prevent cancer. In the following years it is of great importance to improve acceptance and vaccination rates.Copyright © 2018, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Anal infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 16 and 18 and anal cancer are overrepresented in men who have sex with men (MSM). This study investigated HPV prevalence in young MSM before and after the implementation of a school-based quadrivalent HPV (genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccination programme for boys in Australia in 2013. Method(s): In this repeated cross-sectional study, MSM aged 16-20 years were recruited from two successive birth cohorts via sexual health clinics and the community in Melbourne, Australia. The first cohort was before the implementation of gender-neutral vaccination (HYPER1 study, done in 2010-12, NCT01422356), and the second was the post-vaccination cohort (HYPER2 study, done in 2017-18, NCT03000933). Men who self-identified as being same-sex attracted were enrolled, and those recruited via the HYPER2 study had to be resident in Australia since 2013 to ensure eligibility. Study procedures were done in the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre. A clinician-collected anal swab and self-collected penile swab and oral rinse were tested for 28 HPV genotypes, and data on demographics and sexual health practices were collected via questionnaires. Only assessable samples were included in the analyses. We compared anatomical site-specific prevalence of HPV genotypes between cohorts by calculating the prevalence ratio, adjusting for age, circumcision, and sex with women. Herd protection was also assessed, by calculating the adjusted prevalence ratios by vaccination status. Finding(s): 400 MSM, 200 per cohort, were included in the study. In both cohorts, the median number of lifetime male partners was ten (IQR 5-25). The prevalence of any anal quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype was higher in the pre-vaccination cohort (54 [28%] of 193) than in the post-vaccination cohort (14 [7%] of 193; adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 0.24, 95% CI 0.14-0.42), largely driven by decreases in HPV6, followed by HPV11, 16, and 18. Nevertheless, there was also a significant reduction in anal HPV16 and 18 in the post-vaccination cohort from the pre-vaccination cohort (0.31, 0.14-0.68). The prevalence of any penile quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype was also higher in the pre-vaccination cohort (21 [12%] of 177) than in the post-vaccination cohort (11 [6%] of 179; 0.48, 0.24-0.97), driven by decreases in HPV 6 and 11, but not by 16 and 18. The prevalence of any oral quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype was higher in the pre-vaccination cohort (seven [4%] of 200) than in the post-vaccination cohort (one [1%] of 199; 0.10, 0.01-0.97); there were no cases of oral HPV6 or 11 detected in HYPER2. Comparing the pre-vaccinated cohort with the 149 confirmed vaccinated men from HYPER2 showed a reduction in any quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype for anal (0.09, 0.03-0.25) and penile (0.18, 0.05-0.59) infection but not for oral infection (0.17, 0.03-1.08). Interpretation(s): A reduction in anal, penile, and oral quadrivalent vaccine-targeted genotypes occurred in young MSM following the implementation of a school-based gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme. The fall in anal HPV16 and 18 may lead to a reduction in the incidence of anal cancer. Funding(s): Merck and the Australian Government Department of Health.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose. Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA is a more specific marker for cervical lesion screening than HPV DNA. Here, we aimed to develop a new one-step multiplex reverse transcript real-time PCR (MRT-PCR) to detect E6/E7 mRNA from 14 high-risk HPV (hrHPV) genotypes. Methodology. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the MRT-PCR system were validated. Its clinical performance was evaluated by comparing the results with bDNA signal amplification assay and histopathological results. Results. The detection limit of MRT-PCR was 20 to 200 copies per reaction of different HPV genotypes, and no crossreactivity was observed with any other low-risk HPV or other pathogens commonly found in the female genital tract. Using the bDNA signal amplification assay for comparison, a test on 166 clinical samples showed that the overall agreement between the two methods was 95.18% and the one-step MRT-PCR was more sensitive. Further, compared with the histopathological results for the 166 clinical samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the MRT-PCR method were 88.9 and 71.6 %, respectively, and the positive rate for hrHPV E6/E7 mRNA increased with the severity of the cervical lesions. Conclusion. The one-step multiplex RT-PCR for E6/E7 mRNA detection is a simple, fast, universally applicable, sensitive and highly specific method for hrHPV E6/E7 mRNA detection. It is reliable for cervical lesion screening and of potential value in future clinical applications.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Patients with oral cavity cancer (OCC) and oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) are often seen with locoregionally advanced disease requiring complex multimodality treatments. These treatments may have detrimental effects on the oral microbiome, which is critical to maintaining physiological balance and health. Method(s): The effects of different OCC and OPC treatment types on the oral microbiome and metabolomic profiles for 24-month post-treatment in patients with OCC and OPC were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon next-generation sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Result(s): Chemoradiation resulted in oral dysbiosis with specific depletion of genera which regulate the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. These data also correlate with the oral metabolomic profiles with nitric oxide-related precursor, modulator, or catalyst significantly downregulated in saliva samples from patients' postchemoradiation. Conclusion(s): Together, we have shown that oral dysbiosis due to the effects of chemoradiation could potentially have an impact on OCC and OPC patient's quality of life post-treatment.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretreatment 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) volume-based parameters, such as metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis, add more prognostic information in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: The subjects were 47 patients with oropharyngeal SCC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before any treatment and followed by definitive therapy. PET parameters (metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis) and tumor p16/p53 status were evaluated retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: All volume-based PET parameters were found to be significant prognostic factors for DFS, DSS, and OS in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, only metabolic tumor volume for total tumor lesions (cutoff 65) retained an independent association with DFS, DSS, and OS. CONCLUSION: Metabolic tumor volume for total tumor lesions may be a predictive marker for survival outcomes in patients with oropharyngeal SCC with known p16/p53 status.

AB  - Background: Immunosuppression is often considered as an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections (SSI) while performing skin surgery. However, the data on the risk of developing SSI after dermatologic surgery in immunosuppressed patients are limited. Patients and Methods: All patients of the Department of Dermatology and Allergology at the University Hospital of RWTH Aachen in Aachen, Germany, who underwent hospitalization for a dermatologic surgery between June 2016 and January 2017 (6 months), were followed up after surgery until completion of the wound healing process. The follow-up addressed the occurrence of SSI and the need for systemic antibiotics after the operative procedure. Immunocompromised patients were compared with immunocompetent patients. The investigation was conducted as a retrospective analysis of patient records. Result(s): The authors performed 284 dermatologic surgeries in 177 patients. Nineteen percent (54/284) of the skin surgery was performed on immunocompromised patients. The most common indications for surgical treatment were nonmelanoma skin cancer and malignant melanomas. Surgical site infections occurred in 6.7% (19/284) of the cases. In 95% (18/19), systemic antibiotic treatment was needed. Twenty-one percent of all SSI (4/19) were seen in immunosuppressed patients. Conclusion(s): According to the authors' data, immunosuppression does not represent a significant risk factor for SSI after dermatologic surgery. However, larger prospective studies are needed to make specific recommendations on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis while performing skin surgery in these patients.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc.

AB  - Background We assessed prevalence and risk factors for anal human papillomavirus (HPV) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM), who are at high-risk of HPV-related anal cancer. Methods APACHES is a multicentric, prospective study of anal HPV infection and lesions in HIV-positive MSM aged >=35 years. At baseline, participants underwent anal swabs for HPV and cytology, plus high-resolution anoscopy. High-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was tested by Cobas4800, with genotyping of HR-HPV positives by PapilloCheck. Results Among 490 participants, prevalence of HPV16 and HR-HPV was 29% and 70%, respectively, and did not differ significantly by age, sexual behavior, or markers of HIV or immune deficiency. Smoking was the only, albeit weak (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7), predictor of HR-HPV. High-risk HPV and HPV16 prevalence increased strongly with anal diagnosis severity, both by worse cytological/histological (composite) diagnosis at APACHES baseline and worse historical diagnosis. HPV16 rose from 19% among participants who were negative for lesions to 63% among participants with high-grade lesions. In contrast, non-HPV16 HR-HPVs were less prevalent in high-grade (37%) than negative (64%) composite diagnosis, and their causal attribution was further challenged by multiple HPV infections. Conclusions Human papillomavirus 16 is ubiquitously frequent among human immunodeficiency virus -positive men having sex with men, and more strongly associated with high-grade anal lesions than other high-risk types, confirming it as a target for anal cancer prevention.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a leading cause of high mortality in women in developing countries and has a serious impact on women's health. Human papilloma virus (HPV) prophylactic vaccines have been produced and may hold promise for reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. However, the limitations of current HPV vaccine strategies make the development of HPV therapeutic vaccines particularly important for the treatment of HPV related lesions. Our previous work has demonstrated that LM4DELTAhly::E7 was safe and effective in inducing antitumor effect by antigen-specific cellular immune responses and direct killing of tumor cell on a cervical cancer model. In this study, the codon usage effect of a novel Listeria-based cervical cancer vaccine LM4DELTAhly::E7-1, was evaluated for effects of codon-optimized E7 expression, cellular immune response and therapeutic efficacy in a tumor-bearing murine model. Our data demonstrated that up-regulated expression of E7 was strikingly elevated by codon usage optimization, and thus induced significantly higher Th1-biased immunity, lymphocyte proliferation, and strong specific CTL activity ex-vivo compared with LM4DELTAhly::E7-treated mice. Furthermore, LM4DELTAhly::E7-1 enhanced a remarkable therapeutic effect in establishing tumors. Taken together, our results suggest that codon usage optimization is an important consideration in constructing live bacterial-vectored vaccines and is required for promoting effective T cell responses.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Pregnant women diagnosed with CIN3 have high regression rates after delivery. Biomarkers are needed to only identify pregnant women with progressive CIN requiring treatment to reduce overreferral and overtreatment. In our study we evaluated the performance of the FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation test for molecular triage on FFPE samples of CIN3+-diagnosed pregnant women with known clinical course over time as well in a cross-sectional setting. In this German multicenter retrospective study biopsy material was collected from pregnant women diagnosed with cervical cancer (n = 16), with CIN3 that progressed to cancer during pregnancy (n = 7), with CIN3 that regressed to CIN1 or less within 6 months after delivery (n = 41), without CIN (n = 16), CIN3 covering 3-4 quadrants (n = 14) and randomly selected CIN3 (n = 41). FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation analysis was performed blinded on first diagnosis. All pregnant women with cervical cancer and with CIN3 progressing to cancer tested positive for FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation (100%, 22/22). In the regressing CIN3 group 47.5% and in the group without CIN 21.6% tested methylation positive. High-volume CIN3 and random selected CIN3 were methylation-positive in 91.7% and 82.1%, respectively. Methylation levels were significantly higher in progressive CIN3 and cancer compared to the controls (P <.0005). The likelihood ratio of a negative methylation test (LR-) for progressive CIN3+ was 0 (95% CI: 0-0.208). A negative FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation test can rule out progressive CIN disease in pregnant women diagnosed with CIN3. This can help the clinician by managing these pregnant women with conservative follow-up until after delivery.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play significant roles in tumor initiation. MicroRNA-135a (miR-135a) induced the formation of a CD133+ subpopulation from a human papillomavirus-immortalized cervical epithelial cell line. Compared with the CD133- cells, the CD133+ cells expressed higher levels of miR-135a and OCT4, exhibited significantly higher tumorsphere forming capacity and the time required for tumorsphere formation was shortened in the second generation. Serum induction suppressed the expression of CD133, OCT4 and miR-135a, but increased expression of involucrin in the miR-135a-induced CD133+ cells. The miR-135a-induced CD133+ cells were tumorigenic in a limiting dilution approach in vivo. The cells expressed significantly higher level of active beta-catenin and OCT4 than the CD133- counterpart. Wnt3a enhanced the expression of OCT4 and CD133 in cervical cancer cells but failed to enhance CD133 transcription in normal cervical cells. Wnt3a stimulation also increased tumorsphere size and self-renewal of miR-135a-induced CD133+ subpopulation. Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition suppressed tumorsphere formation while Wnt3a partially nullified the inhibitory effect. Taken together, miR-135a induced the formation of a subpopulation of cells with CSC properties both in vitro and in vivo and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is essential to maintain its tumorigenicity.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 is the most common high-risk HPV type identified in oropharyngeal and cervical neoplasia. Recently, HPV-associated oral epithelial dysplasia with specific histopathologic features and demographics similar to HPV-oropharyngeal carcinoma has been identified. The objective of this study was to evaluate histopathologically all cases of HPV-oral epithelial dysplasia seen in one center and identify HPV types in a subset of cases. Cases with specific histopathology for HPV-oral epithelial dysplasia that were positive both by immunohistochemical studies for p16 and by in situ hybridization for high-risk types of HPV were further analyzed using QIAamp DNA Tissue Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was extracted, amplified, and digested with restriction enzymes and run on a polyacrylamide gel. Digestion patterns were visually compared with a database of known HPV digestion patterns for identification. There were 53 specimens included in the analysis. There were 47 males and six females (7.8:1), with a median age of 55 years (range 41-81). The most common site of involvement was the tongue/floor of mouth (77% of cases). Of the 53 cases, 94% exhibited parakeratosis and/or hyperkeratosis. All the cases featured karyorrhexis, apoptosis, and characteristics of conventional carcinoma in situ. The quantity of DNA extracted was sufficient for analysis in 22 cases. HPV-16 was identified in 20/22 (91%) cases. One case was associated with HPV-33 and one with HPV-58 (5% each). Eight of the 53 cases (15%) were associated with invasive squamous cell carcinomas.

AB  - Purpose: Intratumoral hypoxia increases resistance of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) to radiotherapy. [18F]FMISO PET imaging enables noninvasive hypoxia monitoring, though requiring complex logistical efforts. We investigated the role of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) as potential surrogate parameter for intratumoral hypoxia in HNSCC using [18F]FMISO PET/CT as reference. Method(s): Within a prospective trial, serial blood samples of 27 HNSCC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation were collected to analyze plasma IL-6 levels. Intratumoral hypoxia was assessed in treatment weeks 0, 2, and 5 using [18F]FMISO PET/CT imaging. The association between PET-based hypoxia and IL-6 was examined using Pearson's correlation and multiple regression analyses, and the diagnostic power of IL-6 for tumor hypoxia response prediction was determined with receiver-operating characteristic analyses. Result(s): Mean IL-6 concentrations were 15.1, 19.6, and 31.0 pg/mL at baseline, week 2 and week 5, respectively. Smoking (p=0.050) and reduced performance status (p=0.011) resulted in higher IL-6 levels, whereas tumor (p=0.427) and nodal stages (p=0.334), tumor localization (p=0.439), and HPV status (p=0.294) had no influence. IL-6 levels strongly correlated with the intratumoral hypoxic subvolume during treatment (baseline: r=0.775, p<0.001; week 2: r=0.553, p=0.007; week 5: r=0.734, p<0.001). IL-6 levels in week 2 were higher in patients with absent early tumor hypoxia response (p=0.016) and predicted early hypoxia response (AUC=0.822, p=0.031). Increased IL-6 levels at week 5 resulted in a trend towards reduced progression-free survival (p=0.078) and overall survival (p=0.013). Conclusion(s): Plasma IL-6 is a promising surrogate marker for tumor hypoxia dynamics in HNSCC patients and may facilitate hypoxia-directed personalized radiotherapy concepts. Trial registration: The prospective trial was registered in the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00003830). Registered 20 August 2015Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Anal cancer is preceded by high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) infection, predominantly HPV16. No HPV assay is licenced for use in anal screening. We aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of four anal canal swab HPV assays to predict high-grade squamous epithelial lesions (HSIL). Method(s): In a cohort of Australian HIV-positive and negative gay and bisexual men, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of detection of 13 anal HRHPV genotypes by Linear Array (LA), Cobas 4800, EuroArray, and Anyplex II HPV28 (+ and ++ cut offs), compared their ability to predict prevalent anal HSIL, and compared anal canal HRHPV detection with HRHPV isolated from HSIL using laser capture microdissection (LCM). Result(s): A total of 475 participants had baseline results available for all four assays (166, 35.0% HIV positive), and 169 participants had a diagnosis of cytological and/or histological HSIL. The HPV16 and any HRHPV detection were highest with Anyplex II HPV28 (+) (156, 32.8% 95% CI 28.6-37.2 and 359, 75.6%, 95% CI 71.5-79.4, respectively). For detection of concurrent HSIL and HPV16, the assay sensitivity was similar, ranging from 49.1%, 95% CI 41.4-56.9 (Anyplex II HPV28 ++) to 55.0%, 95% CI 47.2-62.7 (Anyplex II HPV28 +). For concurrent HSIL and any HRHPV detection, EuroArray was more specific than Anyplex II HPV28 (+) (45.9% 95% CI 40.2-51.7 vs 36.7%, 95% CI 31.3-42.4, p = 0.021) and had comparable specificity with Anyplex II HPV28 (++) (45.9% vs 47.2%, 95% CI 41.5-53.0, p = 0.75). All assays had high sensitivities for predicting HPV16 detected on LCM (92.5-97.5%). Anyplex II HPV28 and EuroArray were significantly more sensitive than LA for lesions caused by non-HPV16 HRHPV types on LCM. Discussion(s): Anyplex II HPV28 and EuroArray detected more non-16 HRHPV genotypes than LA. Increasing the Anyplex II HPV28 cutoff improved specificity without compromising sensitivity for detection of concurrent HSIL.Copyright © 2022 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases

AB  - It is unclear whether a woman's age influences her risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) upon detection of HPV. A large change in risk as women age would influence vaccination and screening policies. Among 972,029 women age 30-64 undergoing screening with Pap and HPV testing (Hybrid Capture 2, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), we calculated age-specific 5-year CIN3+ risks among women with HPV infections detected at enrollment, and among women with "newly detected" HPV infections at their second screening visit. Women (57,899, 6.0%) had an enrollment HPV infection. Among the women testing HPV negative at enrollment with a second screening visit, 16,724 (3.3%) had a newly detected HPV infection at their second visit. Both enrollment and newly detected HPV rates declined with age (p < 0.001). Women with enrollment versus newly detected HPV infection had higher 5-year CIN3+ risks: 8.5% versus 3.9%, (p < 0.0001). Risks did not increase with age but declined slightly from 30-34 years to 60-64 years: 9.4% versus 7.4% (p = 0.017) for enrollment HPV and 5.1% versus 3.5% (p = 0.014) for newly detected HPV. Among women age 30-64 in an established screening program, women with newly detected HPV infections were at lower risk than women with enrollment infections, suggesting reduced benefit vaccinating women at older ages. Although the rates of HPV infection declined dramatically with age, the subsequent CIN3+ risks associated with HPV infection declined only slightly. The CIN3+ risks among older women are sufficiently elevated to warrant continued screening through age 65.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV), the causative agent of cervical cancer, is also suggested as a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. Many infectious agents besides Helicobacter pylori have been associated with gastritis. The aim of this study was to investigate HPV DNA and genotyping HPV type 16 DNA in gastric adenocarcinoma and Helicobacter pylori gastritis cases. METHODS: A hundred and six gastric adenocarcinoma and Helicobacter pylori gastritis samples and 26 controls were included. After deparaffinization by xylene, DNA extraction was performed by the phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol method and 106 samples were studied with a G6PDH control kit (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Fifty-three adenocarcinoma and 43 Helicobacter pylori samples were thought to have enough tissue and were studied for HPV DNA. HPV types other than 16 and HPV type 16 DNA were detected by Real Time PCR using the L1 region. Amplifications of MY09/11 products were done by GP5+/GP6+ primers and Cyanine-5 labeled HPV DNA and HPV 16 DNA specific probe in Light Cycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) device. RESULTS: Among gastric adenocarcinoma and Helicobacter pylori gastritis samples, 20/53 (38%) and 18/43 (41.8%) were HPV DNA positive, respectively. Five (19.2%) of 26 controls were HPV DNA positive. CONCLUSIONS: Our 38% positive result in the gastric carcinoma group is in concordance with previous reports. This is the first study revealing the HPV-H. pylori relationship in gastritis cases and we concluded that with regard to the nearly three-fold higher HPV DNA (41.8%) in gastritis cases compared to controls, Helicobacter pylori positive cases should also be evaluated in favor of HPV in the gastritis group.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are not uncommon in at-risk populations, for which control requires integrated testing, treatment and prevention. Method(s): From May, 2019 to February, 2020, multiplex real-time PCR assays were prospectively performed to detect Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) in the urine and rectal/vaginal swab specimens collected from HIV-positive patients with a history of STIs or symptoms suggestive of STIs. Patients confirmed to have acquired STIs were treated according to treatment guidelines. Result(s): During the study period, 430 participants (99.1% men who have sex with men and median age 37 years) were included. The overall prevalence of CT, NG, and/or TV infection was 30.0%, including 24.7%, 12.1%, and 0.2% for CT, NG, and TV infection, respectively. The factors associated with CT, NG, and/or TV infection were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity (AOR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.22-6.26), recently acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (AOR, 5.62; 95% CI, 1.99-15.88), using mobile dating application (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.13-3.83), and oral sex (AOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.04-4.32). The rates of CT, NG, and/or TV infection were 50.0% in participants with recent HCV infection, 44.2% in those with HBsAg positivity, and 35.9% in those with incident syphilis. Among participants completing test-of-cure visits, the microbiological cure rate was 91.7% and 90.0% for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively. Conclusion(s): HIV-positive participants had a high prevalence of CT and/or NG, especially those coinfected with viral hepatitis and syphilis. Our results strongly support integrated STI services in the population.Copyright © 2020 Formosan Medical Association

AB  - The prevalence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing globally while the prevalence of other head and neck cancers is decreasing. The most likely reasons for this are a decreasing influence of smoking and the growing relevance of infections with the human papilloma virus (HPV) as a risk factor. A rise in the HPV-attributable fraction (HPV-AF) of OPSCC has been observed in many countries, yet a comprehensive review of prevalence rates and trends in Germany is lacking. To determine the current HPV-AF of OPSCC in Germany and to assess whether it has changed during the last decades, we performed a systematic literature review. We screened Medline and EMBASE for studies that reported the tumor HPV status of newly diagnosed OPSCC patients treated at medical centers in Germany by testing for both HPV DNA and p16INK4a overexpression to confirm involvement of HPV in tumorigenesis. Out of 287 screened studies, 14 studies with data from a total of 1819 OPSCC patients treated between 1988 and 2015 were included in the data synthesis. The reported average HPV-AF varied considerably between the studies, ranging from 11.5% (1988-2008) to 55.0% (2004-2009). Two of the included studies did not only provide the HPV-AF for the entire observed calendar period but also for separate years, allowing to more accurately assess changes over time. These studies reported increases in the HPV-AF from 21% in 2000 to 53% in 2015 and from 38% in 2004 to 71% in 2013, respectively.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Background/Aim: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive epithelial malignancy. It is the most common neoplasm appearing in the upper aerodigestive tract and the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The five-year survival rate remains poor despite advances in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Furthermore, the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer is rising. Thus, innovative therapy approaches are imperative in order to improve the situation. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and sorafenib and sunitinib, multityrosine kinase inhibitors, have been notably effective in the therapy of different tumor entities. The modest side-effects and oral application of the drugs might improve patient compliance. Expression levels of mTOR and Amphiregulin (AREG) in p16-positive and -negative SCC (squamous cell carcino ma) and the effect of everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib on the expression levels of these target proteins were assessed. As far as we are aware of, this is one of the first in vitro studies to evaluate the effect of these small-molecule drugs with regard to the p16 status of SCC cells. Material(s) and Method(s): p16-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells and p16-positive CERV196 cells were exposed to different concentra tions of everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib for 2-8 days. Expression levels of mTOR and AREG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compa red against a chemonaive control. Result(s): AREG and mTOR were expres sed in all tested cell lines. CERV196 displayed a remark able increase of mTOR expres sion compared to p16-negative HNSCC. On the contrary, AREG levels were reduced by 50% in CERV196. Everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib significantly reduced mTOR expres sion. Everolimus significantly decreased AREG expression independently of the HPV status. Sunitinib and sorafenib increa sed AREG expres sion in HNSCC 11A and 14C but not in CERV196. Conclusion(s): The applied drugs showed remark able suppression of mTOR expression, which might delay tumor progression. Interestingly, sorafenib and sunitinib increa sed AREG in HNSCC 11A and 14C, which could be a possi ble evasive mecha nism following incubation with these drugs. On the contrary, p16-positive CERV196 showed in crea sed susceptibility to sorafenib and sunitinib concer ning suppression of AREG expression. Further studies are required to evaluate the HPV-dependent differences of therapy res ponse and the possible consequences for treatment options.Copyright © 2015, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

AB  - Background: In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), cervical cancer is the third leading cause of women cancer. Aim(s): The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the efficacy of careHPVTM test versus conventional Pap smear or Siriraj liquid-based cytology in the detection of cervical cancer in women living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Material(s) and Method(s): Overall, 631 women consented to participate. Four cervical specimens were taken for the purpose of conventional Pap smear, Siriraj liquid-based cytology, careHPVTM test, and HPV-16 genotyping. The exact McNemar test was used to compare the efficacy and diagnostic performance of the tests. Result(s): Of the 631 women with follow-up, 331 were human papillomavirus (HPV) negative. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were found in 37 women, biopsy-proven high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 50 women, and invasive carcinoma in seven women. The proportion of women with high-grade cervical lesion or carcinoma detected after abnormal careHPVTM test was higher (6.02%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4-8.1) than that detected by conventional Pap smear (4.59%; 95% CI: 3.2-6.5). careHPVTM and HPV-16 genotyping had, respectively, the highest sensitivity (80.8%; 95% CI: 67.4-89.5) and specificity (92.2%; 95% CI: 89.8-94.2). HPV-16 was the most frequently detected genotype. Conclusion(s): careHPVTM test represents a screening option in Lao PDR, particularly in women living with HIV-1 because of higher prevalence of chronic HPV in this population.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The benefits of using urine for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA have been evaluated in disease surveillance, epidemiological studies, and screening for cervical cancers in specific subgroups. HPV DNA testing in urine is being considered for important purposes, notably the monitoring of HPV vaccination in adolescent girls and young women who do not wish to have a vaginal examination. The need to optimize and standardize sampling, storage, and processing has been reported. In this paper, we examined the impact of a DNA-conservation buffer, the extraction method, and urine sampling on the detection of HPV DNA and human DNA in urine provided by 44 women with a cytologically normal but HPV DNA-positive cervical sample. Ten women provided first-void and midstream urine samples. DNA analysis was performed using real-time PCR to allow quantification of HPV and human DNA. The results showed that an optimized method for HPV DNA detection in urine should (a) prevent DNA degradation during extraction and storage, (b) recover cell-free HPV DNA in addition to cell-associated DNA, (c) process a sufficient volume of urine, and (d) use a first-void sample. In addition, we found that detectable human DNA in urine may not be a good internal control for sample validity. HPV prevalence data that are based on urine samples collected, stored, and/or processed under suboptimal conditions may underestimate infection rates.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer disease affecting the female population. A key factor in development of the disease is the human papillomavirus infection (HPV). The disease is also impacted by epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, which causes activation or exclusion of certain genes, and simultaneously the hypermethylation of cytosines in the promoters and turn-off of previously active genes occur. In this study, we focused on the introduction of pyrosequencing for the detection of DNA methylation of the selected CADM1 and MAL genes. METHOD(S): DNA was isolated from cytological cervical smear of patients with different types of dysplasia [L-SIL (n=14), ASC-US (n=15), H-SIL (n=l)] and four control samples from healthy women. Prepared samples were further analyzed by bisulfite conversion and subsequent pyrosequencing (Pyromark Q96 ID, Qiagen, Germany). We examined the extent of methylation of CpG islands and as control samples of this method we used a fully methylated and unmethylated DNA. Methylation level (Met level) from each sample was quantified as the mean value [sum of all methylated CpG islands in %/total number of CpG islands (MAL n=4; CADM1 n=3)]. RESULT(S): In total, 30 clinical samples and 4 control samples from healthy women were analyzed. By means of the analysis of the CADMlpromoter region, the values of the Met level were obtained [fully methylated DNA (94.83 and 88); completely unmethylated DNA (0 and 0); and control samples from healthy patients (6.825 and 0.825), L-SIL (2.107 and 2.778), ASC-US (7.313 and 3.626), H-SIL (0 and 0)]. By means of the analysis of the MAL promoter region, the values of Met level were obtained [fully methylated DNA (53.25); completely unmethylated DNA (0.875); and control samples from healthy patients (2.925), L-SIL (1.517), ASC-US (2.833), and H-SIL (4)]. CONCLUSION(S): We introduced a pyrosequencing method for quantification of methylation of CADMl, MAL promoter regions, and detected methylations in clinical samples and also some basal methylation in healthy women.Copyright © 2014 Neuroendocrinology Letters.

AB  - It is now estimated that approximately 10 % of worldwide cancers are attributable to viral infection, with the vast majority (>85 %) occurring in the developing world. Oncogenic viruses include various classes of DNA and RNA viruses and induce cancer by a variety of mechanisms. A unifying theme is that cancer develops in a minority of infected individuals and only after chronic infection of many years duration. The viruses associated with the greatest number of cancer cases are the human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which cause cervical cancer and several other epithelial malignancies, and the hepatitis viruses HBV and HCV, which are responsible for the majority of hepatocellular cancer. Other oncoviruses include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Identification of the infectious cause has led to several interventions that may reduce the risk of developing these tumors. These include preventive vaccines against HBV and HPV, HPV-based testing for cervical cancer screening, anti-virals for the treatment of chronic HBV and HCV infection, and screening the blood supply for the presence of HBV and HCV. Successful efforts to identify additional oncogenic viruses in human cancer may lead to further insight into etiology and pathogenesis as well as to new approaches for therapeutic and prophylactic intervention. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background. Cervical cancer is the third most common genital cancer in women in Germany. The choice of treatment depends on tumor stage, risk factors and individual patient characteristics. Diagnostics and classification. Cervical cancer is clinically classified according to the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage. For this a clinical examination is necessary with the use of a speculum, bimanual vaginal and rectal examination, a gynecological examination with removal of material for cytological diagnostics and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as well as a targeted biopsy by colposcopy or conization. Additionally, special diagnostics include an obligatory gynecological ultrasound investigation and renal sonography and further imaging methods can be helpful in uncertain situations and high-grade tumor stages. Therapy recommendations. Lymph node staging is carried out for all patients with tumor stage FIGO IA2 and higher. Up to tumor stages FIGO IB-IIB, radical hysterectomy combined with pelvic and if necessary para-aortic lymph node staging are performed. Chemoradiotherapy leads to similar results compared to open surgery regarding long-term survival but differs in the side-effect profile and recurrence pattern. Sentinel lymph node dissection is being tested in clinical trials. For patients suffering from locally advanced cancer FIGO stage III primary chemoradiotherapy is recommended and for patients with FIGO stage IV tumors individual treatment should be considered. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is conducted in high risk patients. In advanced FIGO stage IVb and recurrent cervical cancer primary chemotherapy represents the therapeutic option. Conclusion. By adequate diagnostics and therapy decisions over-therapy and under-therapy can be avoided and the optimal treatment for each stage can be found. For the corresponding early tumor stage a fertility-retaining treatment is possible. In this way even comorbidities can be avoided as far as possible by a combination of therapeutic procedures. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes is necessary for the development of cervical cancer. Testing for HPV DNA from liquid based cervical samples can be used as an adjunct to traditional cytological screening. In addition there are ongoing viral load, genotyping, and prevalence studies. Therefore, a sensitive DNA extraction method is needed to maximize the efficiency of HPV DNA detection. The XytXtract Tissue kit is a DNA extraction kit that is rapid and so could be useful for HPV testing, particularly in screening protocols. This study was undertaken to determine the suitability of this method for HPV detection. DNA extraction from HeLa and Caski cell lines containing HPV 18 and 16 respectively together with DNA from five liquid based cervical samples were used in a HPV PCR assay. DNA was also extracted using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as a comparison. DNA extracts were serially diluted and assayed. HPV DNA was successfully detected in cell lines and cervical samples using the XytXtract Tissue kit. In addition, the XytXtract method was found to be more sensitive than the QIAmp method as determined by a dilution series of the extracted DNA. While the XytXtract method is a closed, the QIAamp method uses a spin column with possible loss of DNA through DNA binding competition of the matrix, which could impact on the final extraction efficiency. The XytXtract is a cheap, rapid and efficient method for extracting HPV DNA from both cell lines and liquid based cervical samples. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is more effective in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer than screening using Pap smears. Moreover, HPV testing can be done on a vaginal sample self-taken by a woman, which offers an opportunity to improve screening coverage. However, the clinical accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples is not well-known. We assessed whether HPV testing on self-collected samples is equivalent to HPV testing on samples collected by clinicians. Method(s): We identified relevant studies through a search of PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled all of the following selection criteria: a cervical cell sample was self-collected by a woman followed by a sample taken by a clinician; a high-risk HPV test was done on the self-sample (index test) and HPV-testing or cytological interpretation was done on the specimen collected by the clinician (comparator tests); and the presence or absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or worse was verified by colposcopy and biopsy in all enrolled women or in women with one or more positive tests. The absolute accuracy for finding CIN2 or worse, or CIN grade 3 (CIN3) or worse of the index and comparator tests as well as the relative accuracy of the index versus the comparator tests were pooled using bivariate normal models and random effect models. Finding(s): We included data from 36 studies, which altogether enrolled 154 556 women. The absolute accuracy varied by clinical setting. In the context of screening, HPV testing on self-samples detected, on average, 76% (95% CI 69-82) of CIN2 or worse and 84% (72-92) of CIN3 or worse. The pooled absolute specificity to exclude CIN2 or worse was 86% (83-89) and 87% (84-90) to exclude CIN3 or worse. The variation of the relative accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples compared with tests on clinician-taken samples was low across settings, enabling pooling of the relative accuracy over all studies. The pooled sensitivity of HPV testing on self-samples was lower than HPV testing on a clinician-taken sample (ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.85-0.91] for CIN2 or worse and 0.89 [0.83-0.96] for CIN3 or worse). Also specificity was lower in self-samples versus clinician-taken samples (ratio 0.96 [0.95-0.97] for CIN2 or worse and 0.96 [0.93-0.99] for CIN3 or worse). HPV testing with signal-based assays on self-samples was less sensitive and specific than testing on clinician-based samples. By contrast, some PCR-based HPV tests generally showed similar sensitivity on both self-samples and clinician-based samples. Interpretation(s): In screening programmes using signal-based assays, sampling by a clinician should be recommended. However, HPV testing on a self-sample can be suggested as an additional strategy to reach women not participating in the regular screening programme. Some PCR-based HPV tests could be considered for routine screening after careful piloting assessing feasibility, logistics, population compliance, and costs.

AB  - Background. Despite significant improvements in the multimodal treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region (HNSCC) the 5-year overall survival rate remains in the range of 40-50%. A detailed understanding of tumor biology and cellular mechanisms of tumor progression, treatment resistance and metastasis can lead to novel therapeutic approaches for improvement of clinical outcome.Objective. Description of the most important molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and progression of HNSCC and summary of current and novel strategies of targeted molecular therapy of HNSCC.Material and methods. This article presents a comprehensive literature research focusing on studies on tumor biology, prognostic and predictive biomarkers of HNSCC, discussion of established correlations between molecular characteristics and clinical outcome and collation of novel therapeutic strategies in development.Results. The HNSCC can be considered a very heterogeneous neoplasm. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and p16Ink4, activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hyperactivity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway as well as aberrations in DNA repair belong to the most frequent molecular changes which significantly influence tumor biology and clinical outcome. Currently, the most successful targeted treatment of HNSCC is blocking of EGFR, one of the most important modulators of tumor progression and treatment resistance. Other molecular agents in (pre) clinical development are inhibitors of PI3K/AKT, mTOR, PARP, COX and hypoxia-associated factors. The knowledge of oropharyngeal carcinoma associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) representing a biologically and clinically distinct group, has led to the development of HPV-specific treatment concepts. Validated predictive biomarkers for resistance or sensitivity to targeted treatment alone or in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy are still missing.Discussion. For improvement in treatment of HNSCC a further increase in translational research efforts on the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression and treatment resistance are essential. The results from such studies will build the basis for the development of novel targeted therapies and corresponding biomarkers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16INK4a expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16INK4A- positive and p16INK4A-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - HPV-vaccinated women develop CIN III very rarely. We have identified a study group of 38 such patients and showed that a specific HPV genotype prevalence in those cases equals the prevalence of HPV genotypes in CIN III present in the general Czech population. In all cases, CIN III was diagnosed within 3 years after having completed the HPV vaccination. We conclude that dysplasia was present before the vaccination in those women. A history of abnormal pre-vaccination PAP smear result (present in 78 % of women in the study group) and age of over 17 by the time of vaccination completion (97 % of women in the study group) are identified as probable factors increasing the risk of CIN III development after HPV vaccination.

AB  - Background: Estimates of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence in a population prior to and after HPV vaccine introduction are essential to evaluate the short-term impact of vaccination. Method(s): Between 2010 and 2012 we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in Germany to determine HPV prevalence, genotype distribution and risk factors for HPV-infection in women aged 20-25 years. Women were recruited by a two-step cluster sampling approach. A home-based self-collection of cervicovaginal lavages was used. Specimens were analysed using a general primer GP5+/GP6+-based polymerase chain reaction and genotyped for 18 high-risk and 6 low-risk HPV- strains by Luminex-based multiplexed genotyping. Result(s): Among 787 included women, 512 were not vaccinated against HPV. In the non-vaccinated population, HPV prevalence of any type was 38.1%, with HPV 16 (19.5%) being the most prevalent genotype. Prevalence of any high-risk type was 34.4%, and in 17.4% of all women, more than one genotype was identified. A higher number of lifetime sexual partners and low educational status were independently associated with HPV-infection. In 223 vaccinated women, prevalence of HPV 16/18 was significantly lower compared to non-vaccinated women (13.9% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.007). When stratifying by age groups, this difference was only significant in women aged 20-21 years, who at time of vaccination were on average younger and had less previous sexual contacts than women aged 22-25 years. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate a high prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes in non-vaccinated women living in Germany that can be potentially prevented by vaccination. Probable first vaccination effects on the HPV prevalence were observed in women who were vaccinated at younger age. This finding reinforces the recommendation to vaccinate girls in early adolescence. © 2014 Delere et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This study describes the distribution and the trends of cervical abnormalities in Israel, based on Pap smear results. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of cervical smears received by the Central Pathology Laboratory of Maccabi Healthcare Services between January 2005 and December 2010. Result(s): In total, 711,541 Pap smears were screened in the study period. Cytological abnormalities were observed in 4.78 % of the total smears screened. An increase was observed in the rate of positive results from 2.63 % in 2005 to 6.78 % in 2010 (p = 0.0026). The cervical abnormalities in the study period distributed as follows: atypical squamous cell (ASC) - 2.72 %, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) - 1.54 %, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) - 0.34 %, squamous cell carcinoma - 0.01 %, atypical glandular cells (AGC) - 0.10 %, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) - 0.06 % and invasive adenocarcinoma - 0.01 %. The increase was statistically significant for ASC (p = 0.0028), LSIL (p = 0.0069) and for HSIL (p = 0.0260). The mean ages at diagnosis of women with ASCUS, LSIL, HSIL, squamous cell carcinoma, AGC, AIS and adenocarcinoma were 37.8, 33.2, 38.6, 55.4, 41.1, 49.9 and 57.1 years, respectively. Conclusion(s): The increase in the rate of squamous cell abnormalities demonstrated in this study emphasizes the need of implementing an education and a screening program among Israeli women. HPV vaccine, sexual behavior, cytology performance and HPV test are primary and secondary prevention tools which may reduce morbidity and mortality in the future. In addition, based on the age at diagnosis of the different pathologies, the age group in which Pap test is performed in Israel should be expanded from 35-54 to 25-65 years. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical significance of "atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" ASC-H by comparing the original cytologic findings with follow-up tissue biopsies, and its association with high-risk HPV. METHODS: A total of 235,518 ThinPrep Pap tests were performed at our institution from January 2008 through December 2010, but only 727 (0.3%) of these cases were diagnosed as ASC-H. RESULTS: Of the 309 cases diagnosed as ASC-H on cytology for which follow-up histologic material was available, 120 (38.8%) were definitively diagnosed as high-grade dysplasia (CIN 2/3) and 75 (24.2%) showed features of low-grade dysplasia (CIN 1). We observed that the incidence of dysplasia in patients less than 30 years of age was 73.4% (113/154) and 48.3% (14/29) in patients greater than 49 years of age (p = 0.001). There were 71 cases for which high-risk HPV DNA testing was conducted. HPV DNA was found to be positive in 41 of the dysplastic cases (CIN 1 = 18 cases and CIN 2/3 = 23) and negative in six of the dysplastic cases (CIN1 = 2 and CIN2/3 = 4). CONCLUSION: We conclude that cases diagnosed as ASC-H should be followed-up with caution as they are strongly associated with dysplasia of any grade (63.1%), especially high-grade dysplasia (38.8%). Reflex HPV DNA testing is an important predictor of dysplasia with a positive predictive value of 87.2% in our study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of the BD Onclarity HPV Assay (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) in BD SurePath liquid-based cytology media with that of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) samples co-collected in specimen transport medium in an adjudicated patient cohort. METHODS: The performance of the BD Onclarity HPV Assay using BD SurePath media was compared with that of HC2 samples co-collected in specimen transport medium using 541 archived samples from a multicenter US clinical trial with histologically adjudicated cervical biopsy specimens. RESULTS: The sensitivity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 positivity (n - 104) was 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83-95) and 93.3% (95% CI, 87-97) and specificity was 76.9% (95% CI, 73-81) and 77.8% (95% CI, 74-82) for the BD assay and HC2, respectively. Nine cases of CIN 2+ had results discordant with the high-risk HPV assay. All were found to have been correctly classified with the BD assay using a novel WAVE denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography double-stranded DNA sequencing method. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical performance of The BD Onclarity HPV Assay with respect to histology end points was similar to HC2. Moreover, discordant analysis revealed improved performance of the BD assay with respect to ability to provide extended genotyping information and lack of cross-reactivity with low-risk HPV types associated with cellular abnormalities. The relative risks for CIN 3 disease for HPV 31 and HPV 33/58 (combined) were comparable to that of HPV 18 in this population, suggesting that these genotypes may warrant monitoring in future studies.

AB  - A human papilloma virus (HPV) test can be used to identify women that are at risk for cervical cancer. Hybrid Capture (HC2) and PCR are the current gold standard assays and are used globally to detect HPV infection. We present a combined assay system that uses PCR and fluorescence (FL) DNA chip for simple, rapid, and sensitive HPV DNA detection. In the developed assay system, PCR-amplified DNA produced by biotin-labeled consensus GP5+/GP6+ primers was denatured, neutralized, mixed with FL-streptavidin detector solution and then the mixture was loaded onto the HPV DNA chip for DNA hybridization. The DNA chip was inserted into the laser FL scanner and the FL signal was measured. MgCl2 of PCR mixture completely nullified FL signal in DNA chip assay but addition of 50mM EDTA to detector solution recovered FL signal. When PCR product of HPV 16 or 18 infected patient's sample was subjected to DNA chip assay, FL signal was observed only from its corresponding HPV type DNA chip, demonstrating the HPV assay system differentiate different HPV genotypes. In rapidity and sensitivity test, the FL signal was illuminated from a PCR product produced by 5 cycles, which did not resolve as a DNA band in gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the combined assay system is more sensitive than an HPV PCR assay. Additionally, this test can be completed within 30 minutes, which will allow patients to be evaluated for infection. © 2014 The Korean BioChip Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the tenth most common cancer in women in developed countries that have national screening programs, while it is in the second line in underdeveloped countries. According to Ministry of Health registry data, cervical cancer is the eighth most common cancer among female cancers in Turkey. Today, the most effective screening for cervical cancer is to obtain smears from the cervix. Therefore, periodic screening programs are of great importance in identifying preinvasive lesions to prevent their progression to invasive cancer. Today, with the use of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, screening programs have brought new insights into the prevention of cervical cancer. Management of preinvasive lesions has to be known by each obstetrics and gynecology specialist. Redundant procedures and treatments can be avoided by directing patients correctly at this step. Cancer phobia should not be created. Ablative or destructive treatments should not be done without histological diagnosis; hysterectomy, which has an equal risk of recurrence, should not be recommended. © 2014 by the Turkish-German Gynecological Education and Research Foundation.

AB  - Papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer remains a major disease burden for young women. Therefore, it plays an important role in the pathological diagnosis. Besides cytological and classical pathological methods, molecular biology tests are used for the analysis of HPV status. Here we compare three PCR assays for the detection of human papillomavirus DNA from 50 gynecological samples, namely the HPV Genotyping Kit HPVsign (Qiagen, Germany), a novel HPV-genotyping kit based on pyrosequencing, the LCD array HPV Type 3.5 (Chipron, Germany) and an in-house PCR of the National Reference Center for Papilloma-and Polyomaviruses at the Institute for Virology of the University Cologne (Germany). The HPVsign assay mainly detected the assumed leading HPV type, while both the in-house PCR and the Chipron HPV Assay 3.5 reproducibly detected single and multiple infections. © 2014 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Background: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are major oncogenic viruses to human. Currently, 169 HPV types have been characterized at the genome level belonging either to alpha-, beta- or gamma papillomaviruses. Most of the HPVs causing mucosal infections belong to alpha papillomaviruses, of which nearly 20 are so-called high risk HPV types associated with premalignant and malignant lesions of the epithelia. The most intensively studied area has been the association between HPV and cervical cancer. From the natural history studies we have learn that HPV infection is mandatory but not sufficient to cause cancer alone as other risk factors are also needed, such as multiple sexual partners, early age of sexual activity, other infections and smoking. Already in the early 80's we provided the first evidence on HPV as an etiological factor in a subgroup of head and neck cancers, which has now been approved by the International Agency of Research of Cancer (IARC) particularly for the cancers of tonsils and the base of the tongue. The association between HPV and oral cancer has been more controversial. Until now, a total of 6,238 oral carcinoma (OSCC) samples have been analyzed for HPV DNA and 24% were shown to be positive. The wide variation (from 0% to 100%) in the HPV detection rate can be explained by sampling, methods applied, materials studies and the number of cases included in the analysis. The two most prevalent HPV types in OSCC are HPV 16 and 18, far exceeding the detection rate of all the other types together. Based on meta-analysis on case and control studies it is 4 to 5 times more likely to find HPV DNA in oral cancer samples than in the normal mucosa. Also the low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 and the skin type HPV 2 have been identified in OSCCs. Seropositivity of HPV16 has been associated with increased risk of head and neck cancer but not with cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in adult genital area have been widely studied. Also several studies on HPV and head and neck cancer have been performed. As persistent high-risk HPV infection is the key event in the progression of HPV lesions and more data are urgently needed on asymptomatic oral HPV infections. Currently, nearly nothing is known about the natural history of oral HPV-infection. So far we have been the only research group to run prospective follow-up studies on oral HPV infection for more than 6 years, although other studies on the same topic have been started worldwide with still a maximum of two years follow-up. The main results of our natural history studies on oral HPV infection in women and men are shortly summarized below. Study designs of finnish family HPV study. Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is the key event in the progression of HPV lesions and more data are urgently needed on asymptomatic oral HPV infections. The Finnish Family HPV Study was started in 1998 to understand the dynamics of HPV infection within regular Finnish families. We initially followed-up 331 women (mean age, 25.5+3.4 years) pregnant at their baseline visit, their 131 spouses (mean age, 28.8+5.0 years) and 333 newborns for 36 months. Subsequently, the follow-up was extended to 6 years, over 50% of the cohort being compliant with that. The study protocol includes a detail medical history and questionnaire on sexual habits, in addition to extensive serial sampling starting from the baseline visit before delivery, at delivery and at month 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 72, including samples of sera, saliva, placenta, breast milk and semen. We have published several papers on genital and oral HPV infections in this cohort, including data also on HPV serology and lately even HPV-induced cell mediated immunity in a subgroup of this cohort. Specific aims of the finnish family HPV study. The most important goals in the Finnish Family Study has been to establish the natural history of oral HPV infection in the mothers, fathers and the children followed from birth to the age of 6-8 years. Specifically, we were interested to determine the HPV genotype distribution found on oral mucosa in addition to the incidence, clearance and persistent times and rates for each HPV-genotype identified. Also the aims were to understand whether the risk factors of oral HPV infections are the same as found for genital HPV infection. Method(s): Serial oral scrapings were taken from 331 women and 131 spouses at baseline and at 2-month, 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, 36-month and 7-year follow-up visits to accomplish incident, cleared and persistent HPV infections. DNA was extracted using high salt extraction method. HPV-genotyping was performed at each visit using nested PCR and Multimetrix kit (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany), which detect 24 genotypes. Covariates of incident, cleared and persistent oral HPV infections were analysed using the generalised estimating equation (GEE) and Poisson regression. Result(s): Oral HPV infection in the women: In the women the following outcome patterns of oral HPV-infections (n=326) were defined: 1) always negative (n=143), 2) incident HPV (n=116), 3) type-specific persistence (n=51), 4) non type-specific persistence (n=12), 5) fluctuation (n=33) and 6) clearance=transient (n=76). Predictors of type-specific acquisition, clearance and persistence of species 7/9 genotypes (species including HPV16/HPV18 and their closest genotypes) were determined by generalized estimating equation models. Oral HPV-detection in the women varied from 15% to 24% during the follow-up. The following single-type infections were found: HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 45, 56, 58, 59, 66, 70. HPV 16 was the most prevalent, followed by HPV 6, 56, 58. Multiple-type infections with species 9 were most common, followed by species 6, 10 and 7. Altogether, 115 baseline HPV-negative women acquired incident oral HPV infection, while 79 women cleared their infection. The protective factors for incident oral HPV-species 7/9 infections were 1) new pregnancy during follow-up and 2) having the same sexual partner during FU. The mean time to clearance for HPV 6 and 11 was shorter than that for HPV 16, 58, 59, 4.6-2.5mo versus 18.8-37mo, respectively. Increased clearance was related with older age and a history of atopic reactions, whereas previous sexually transmitted disease and new pregnancy were associated with decreased clearance. HPV 16, multiple-type infections and HPV6 persisted most frequently with a mean time of 18-20 months. The predictors of persistent oral HPV infection with the species 9 were mothers being seropositive to LR-HPVs at baseline, use of oral contraceptives, consumption of alcohol and second pregnancy during FU. Clinical oral lesions were detected in 17% of the women, one-third of whom had persistent oral HPV-infections. Oral HPV infection in the men (spouses): The point prevalence of oral HPV infection in men fluctuated from 15.1% to 31.1% during the follow-up period. In total, 17 different HPV genotypes were found. Oral HPV infections in men were associated with the number of sexual partners (p=0.047; 95% CI 0.041-0.052). Genotype-specific HPV persistence was detected in 18/129 men with mean persistence time ranging from 6.0 to 30.7 months. History of genital warts decreased (p=0.0001; OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.33-0.51) and smoking increased (p=0.033, OR=1.92, 95% CI 1.05-3.50) the risk of persistent species 7/9 HPV infections. Of the 74 HPV-positive men, 71.6% cleared their infection actuarial and crude clearance times, varying between 1.4 and 79.6 months. No independent predictors were identified for species 7/9 clearance. At the last follow-up-visit, 50.1% of the fathers had oral mucosal changes, correlating only with smoking (p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Persistent HPV infection is mandatory but not sufficient alone for the progression of HPV infection toward carcinoma. As HPV has now been accepted to be the 3rd most important risk factor of head and neck cancers after smoking and heavy alcohol use, the natural history of oral HPV infection has to be known. This is why we started the Finnish Family Study in 1998. The conclusions of our main results on oral HPV infection in women and men with seven years follow-up are as follows: In the women, the HPV type spectrum in oral mucosa is narrower than that reported in the genital tract. HPV16 and HPV6 were the most common genotypes in oral HPV-infections and were also most likely to persist. Oral HPV infection was not associated with oral sex. Use of oral contraceptives and a second pregnancy protected against oral HPV persistence. In women neither the presence nor the dynamics of oral HPV DNA had any correlation with HPV serology. In the men, oral HPV DNA carriage is common. Also in men, HPV16 was the most prevalent genotype to cause an incident oral HPV-infection followed by HPV 33 and HPV 82. Most of the persisting oral infections are caused by HPV 16. Smoking increased, while previous genital warts decreased oral HR-HPV persistence in men. No predictors of HR-HPV clearance were disclosed. A stable marital relationship protects against oral HPV infection in men.

AB  - Introduction: Switzerland does not implement a state-organized cervical screening program instead opportunistic screening is performed. Method(s): Data of incidence /mortality rates of cervical cancer were obtained from the EUCAN database (http://eco.iarc.fr/ EUCAN/CancerOne.aspx?Cancer=25{00AMP00}Gender=2). Personal observations. Result(s): Opportunistic screening is very successful with Switzerland having one of the lowest incidence (4,2/100'000) and mortality rates (1,6/100'000) of cervical cancer in Europe. Still, screening guidelines were changed in 2012. A 3-year screening interval was proposed for women above the age of 30 and a 2-year screening interval for women between the age of 20 and 30 exhibiting prior negative cytology exams. Reflex HPV-PCR testing was recommended in women with ASCUS or AGC cytology by the Swiss Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology. These guidelines have been met with reservations. Many gynecologists and patients alike would prefer to continue annual screening. In addition, the value of HPV-PCR is disputed in the German part of Switzerland. This is reflected by the unwillingness of many gynecologists to perform HPV reflex-testing in patients with ASCUS or AGC cytology and instead to repeat cytology exams. In the French part of Switzerland a more open-minded view of HPV-PCR testing has been adopted. A 5-year co-testing strategy combining cytology and HPV-PVR has been proposed for women above the age of 30 and is already implemented by some clinicians. Conclusion(s): Thus, cervical cancer screening is changing in Switzerland. However, the new guidelines are not yet well accepted and are not stringently adhered to by gynecologists.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common newly acquired, sexually transmitted infection worldwide, infects about 75% of sexually active individuals in their lifetimes. The high-risk HPV types, the most common of which are HPV 16 and 18, cause cervical and other anogenital cancers, as well as some head and neck cancers [1]. Different HPV types are related to different lesion grades. HPV16 is found in about half of cervical cancers, the majority of anal cancers and about 30% of oropharyngeal cancers, besides a significant proportion of vulvar, vaginal and penile carcinomas. The low-risk types, the most common of which are HPV 6 and 11, cause genital warts, low-grade cervical dysplasias and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Most of our understanding of HPV and carcinogenesis is derived from studies of women and cervical cancer. However, it is clear that HPV causes a significant proportion of tumors in both women and men [2]. Therefore, new prophylactic HPV vaccines have the power to prevent many HPV infections, thus reducing the burden of HPV-associated diseases. Two vaccines have been developed, a quadrivalent vaccine that protects against HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11 (Merck & Co., USA) and a bivalent vaccine that protects against HPV 16 and 18 (Glaxo Smith-Kline, Belgium). Both vaccines are composed of HPV L1 proteins that have spontaneously selfassembled into virus-like particles (VLPs). However, they have different manufacturers, valencies, adjuvants and are produced in different types of cells. Both are administered by intramuscular injection, in three doses (0, 1 or 2 and 6 months). In a number of clinical trials conducted in thousands of subjects in many countries since 1998, the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of these HPV VLP vaccines have been demonstrated [3]. Prophylactic efficacy was measured considering HPV infection and disease endpoints, particularly high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse for the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and genital warts, for the quadrivalent vaccine only. For both the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, results of different trials allow for the examination of broad trends in efficacy in preventing HPV 6/11/16/18-related disease in several groups of patients categorized according to their HPV status at baseline. Very high efficacy rates were observed in naive women for the vaccine-HPV types which led to the recommendation of the vaccine to young individuals, prior to exposure to HPV which occurs concomitant to sexual activity onset. Cross-protection against non-vaccine types was also noted, but the significance and durability of protection is yet to be defined. To increase the coverage to more than 70% of cervical cancers attributable to HPV 16 and 18, it is possible that the best and most efficient responses will be obtained with multivalent vaccines against a larger number of genital, anal and oropharyngeal HPV infections which are presently under development [4]. VLPs are noninfectious protein subunit vaccines and show safety profiles similar to other protein subunit vaccines such as tetanus or hepatitis B vaccines. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated in clinical trials and maintain a good safety profile after licensure. Since the VLP vaccines were designed primarily to protect by inducing virion neutralizing antibodies, type specific antibody responses to the VLPs have been the primary focus of immunogenicity studies. Both vaccines were shown to be highly immunogenic in the clinical trials, resulting in essentially 100% seroconversion in the different populations studied which included both females and males. Both vaccines induce the expected B cell memory response which is a property of vaccines with durable immune responses. Although the long term persistence of stable antibody levels is an encouraging finding, the antibody levels needed to prevent infection or disease are currently unknown. However, long-term follow-up studies have shown that efficacy is maintained for at least ten years and modeling studies suggest protection may last much longer. Available data do suggest that HPV vaccines may provide a lengthy period of protection, likely to usher a vaccinated individual through the years of highest infection risk and beyond. Additional studies are ongoing to verify these projections. HPV vaccines introduction and implementation. Based on its demonstrated clinical efficacy and favorable safety profile, HPV prophylactic vaccines have been introduced in hundreds of countries around the world, including most countries in Latin America. In Brazil, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was approved in 2006 and the bivalent vaccine in 2008 [5]. The rapid approval and launch of such vaccines are a clear indication that governments and policy makers are aware of the expected impact on the prevention of one of the most common causes of female mortality worldwide. In 2007, Australia was one of the first countries to introduce the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in a public immunization programme for girls and young women. Four years after the beginning of the HPV vaccination program, a substantial decrease in vaccine-targeted genotypes is evident. In fact, a dramatic reduction in genital warts was observed in young women as well as young men, an indication of herd immunity [6]. On the other hand, older women and men, as well as men who have sex with men, show very little or no reduction of this benign tumor caused by low-risk HPV types. These results led Australia to include young men in their national immunization program which, in time, translate into reductions in HPV-related lesions in both genders. Moreover, a reduction in high-grade cervical abnormalities is being observed as a consequence of the introduction of HPV vaccination [7]. Similar results are rapidly accumulating in several countries which implemented national HPV vaccination programs including New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Canada, and USA. Despite such very positive results, incorporation of HPV vaccination in the public health sector is still to be seen in the developing world, mostly due to vaccine cost. HPV vaccine implementation will also depend on local infrastructure for vaccine delivery to the initial target population during the window of highest vaccine efficacy, i.e., prior to sexual exposure. Furthermore, introducing HPV vaccines in the present cervical cancer control system is hampered by the fact that secondary screening with Pap tests (or HPV DNA testing) will still be required to detect cervical cancers and pre-cancers caused by nonvaccine HPV types [8]. Ongoing cost-benefit studies and negotiations between governments, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations, are enabling several developing countries, where the vaccine is most needed, to implement the necessary programs [9]. The Ministry of Health of Brazil has announced in June 2013 the decision to introduce the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the national immunization program. From 2014, this vaccine will be offered to girls and adolescents 11-12 years old. The details of the program are largely unknown which includes the possibility of an extended vaccination schedule (0, 6, 60 months; in clinical trials 0, 2 6 months). The success of the prophylactic vaccines against HPV is clear. However, these vaccines are not and will not be available in the short run, as public immunization program in many countries. Moreover, the coverage rates will vary at large due to economic restrictions and other issues. Vaccine acceptance is largely de-termined by health beliefs, such as the individual's perceived susceptibility to the disease, vaccine characteristics, such as cost and efficacy, and obstacles to obtaining the vaccine. Education of physicians, policy makers, parents and adolescents will be crucial for delivering HPV vaccines to target populations during the window of highest vaccine efficacy, prior to sexual debut. Despite all efforts and the excellent results observed in real life, it may take some time before these vaccines are administered to the general population worldwide. Moreover, women will still be at risk for developing cancers caused by other HPV types not included in the vaccine and hence screening and monitoring strategies will be required. It is important to stress that disease outcomes should be recorded since at present there is no immune correlate and the importance of serum antibody levels is simply not known. Moreover, vaccinated populations should be followed-up for long-term safety, sustained immune responses and vaccine disease efficacy [10].

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 cytology for CIN3+ when used for triage of HPV positive women with LSIL age 30 and older. Method(s): Deidentified residual specimens of SurePath cytology medium were obtained following cotesting of 2400 women members of a large health maintenance organization (HMO) age 30 and older who were Hybrid Capture 2 positive. Cytology slides from the residual material were created, stained for p16/Ki-67, and interpreted at MTM Laboratories/Roche Molecular Diagnostics in Heidelberg, Germany. Slide evaluators had no knowledge of the histologic outcomes determined by HMO pathologists. Results did not influence clinical management. This study was approved by the HMO IRB and judged exempt by the NCI IRB. Result(s): Colposcopic biopsy results were available for 451 women age 30+ with HPV positive LSIL. The p16/Ki-67 positivity in this population was 65%. The sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 for CIN3+ was 93% and the risk of CIN3+ among women negative for p16/Ki-67 was 1.2% (1-NPV), a level for which 1 year follow up is recommended in current national guidelines (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Sensitivity for CIN3+ of p16/Ki-67 from SurePath medium in women with HPV positive LSIL is sufficient that immediate colposcopy is not required for women who are p16/Ki-67 negative. Compared to current guidelines for LSIL cytology, p16/ Ki-67 triage could reduce immediate referral to colposcopy by 35%. Unlike p16 alone, which requires morphologic assessment of p16-positive cells, p16/Ki-67 evaluation is based on staining alone and may be fully automated. Further studies are required to evaluate p16/Ki-67 for triage of HPV-positive women with NILM and ASC-US. If a negative predictive value of similar magnitude is observed for these women, a substantial and welcome decrement in the total number of colposcopies required will be possible without significant loss of sensitivity for the screening program.

AB  - Background: Genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided novel insights in the genomic landscape of squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region (SCCHN). This is the first report on its application within a phase III trial of concurrent chemoradiation in locally advanced SCCHN. Method(s): Between 2004 and 2008, 364 patients with stage IV SCC of the oro- or hypopharynx were treated with hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with cisplatin/5-FU or mitomycin C/5-FU. From 174 patients (48%) FFPE samples could be collected. HPV DNA PCR and p16 immunohistochemistry were carried out. From 106 cases (29%) targeted NGS was possible. Based on previous reports an SCCHN panel was designed comprised of 224 exons from 53 genes (mean coverage 3000-fold, minimum 370-fold). Only non-synonymous germline and somatic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with an allele frequency of >5% were considered. SNP were classified according to a damage-score prediction algorithm. Kaplan-Meier-analysis, log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed. Result(s): The most frequent germline/somatic SNP were found in TP53 (total 94%, disruptive mutations 22%)followed by FAT1, PCDH15, KDR, PDGFRA and NOTCH1 (14%),with disruptive mutations in TP53 and NOTCH1 being almost mutually exclusive.Disruptive mutations in TP53 were significantly associated with an HPV-negative status and correlated with reduced OS (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.65, p=0.0005) and PFS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.69, p=0.001). In contrast, NOTCH1 mutations were not related to HPV status, were significantly associated with improved OS (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.7, p=0.039) and showed a trend to improved PFS (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.9-5.1, p=0.07). Disruptive mutations in TP53 and NOTCH1 remained significant after correction for smoking, HPV and treatment. Conclusion(s): Targeted NGS revealed three SCCHN subgroups with distinct outcomes after chemoradiation. As discriminative factors we identified HPV, NOTCH1 and disruptive TP53 mutations. The functional relevance of NOTCH1 mutations for radio-/chemosensitivity remains to be determined.

AB  - Background: Women>=30 years of age with negative (NILM) Pap tests and positive (+) HPV cotesting results have a higher absolute risk of 2-10% of developing CIN 3 in the next 2 years. For this reason, the cAmerican Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) recommends repeat cotesting in 12 months or reflex genotyping for HPV16 or HPV 16/18 (Saslow et al. CA Cancer J Clin. 2012;62:147). If genotyping is not an option, timely quality assurance (QA) re-screen of such Pap tests may be a valuable alternative. Design(s): Over the past 3 year-9-month-period (10/2009-06/2013) all ThinPrep (TP) Pap tests (PT) interpreted as NILM or NILM with reactive cellular changes (NILM/ RCC) and a (+) HPV [Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), Qiagen, Hilden, Germany] cotesting result, undergo monthly QA review by the cytology supervisor and medical director. All TPPT were screened by the TP Imaging System [(TIS), Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA]. Results were also stratified by age for the HPV (+) group. Follow-up (F/U) was obtained for re-classified cases. Result(s): A total of 25,675 (NILM, 22,580; NILM/RCC, 3095) TPPT underwent HPV cotesting. Overall, HPV test was (+) in 2300 (8.96%) TPPT cases: NILM, 1,889 (8.37%) and NILM/RCC, 411 (13.28%). HPV (+) cases by age group were: <=29, 486 (21%) and>=30, 1,814 (79%). Upon QA review 10/2300 (0.43%) cases were reclassified as: ASCUS, 7 and ASC-H, 3. The 10 pts. were: <=29, 1 with ASCUS and>= 30, 9 (ASCUS, 6 and ASC-H, 3). F/U was available in 8/10 (80%) cases within 3-12 months in 5/7 ASCUS and all 3 ASC-H cases. The F/U for 5 ASCUS cases was: NILM on repeat Pap, 1 and negative biopsy (Bx), 4. F/U for 3 ASC-H cases was: HSIL on repeat Pap, 2 and endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) on Bx, 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Timely QA review of HPV positive, cytology negative Pap tests is a valuable monitor for patient care. 90% of reclassified cases were in>=30 age group and 70% were signed out by using TIS 22 Field of View only.

AB  - This study was aimed to screen human papillomavirus (HPV) types associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma of Kazakh in Xinjiang using the gene chip technique and study the clinical significance of this application. The DNAs were collected from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues and healthy esophageal mucosa of Kazakh adults in Xinjiang, and amplified firstly using HPV MY09/11 and then using HPV G5+/6+ to screen positive HPV specimens. These positive specimens were further detected by the gene chip technique to screen highly pathogenic HPV types. After determination with nested PCR amplification with HPV MY09/11 and G5+/6+, the infection rate of HPV was 66.67% in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma group and 12.12% in the healthy control group. By testing the positive HPV specimens from the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma group, the infection rate of HPV16 was 97.72% and the co-infection rate of HPV16 and HPV18 was 2.27%. HPV16 infection may be involved in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Xinjiang Hazakh adults. © 2014 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: After transplantation the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is significantly increased. Immunosuppression with calcineurin-inhibitors (CNIs) is associated with the development of NMSC. Association to the individual immunosuppressive loads of CNIs assessed by residual NFAT-regulated gene expression was investigated in renal allograft recipients. Method(s): Renal allograft recipients from the Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, were included. All patients had a regular annual skin examination. Residual expression of NFAT-regulated genes (IL-2, IFNgamma, GM-CSF) in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood was measured by quantitative real-time PCR at predose and 2h after Ciclosporin A (CsA) intake. Result(s): 258 renal allograft recipients were enrolled (160 male, age 51+/-14y). Of these patients 75 allograft recipients developed NMSCs after renal transplantation (29.1%). The following NMSCs were histologically confirmed: 36 basal cell carcinoma, 34 squamous cell carcinoma, 33 actinic keratosis, 27 Bowen disease, 8 kerato-acanthoma. As risk factors to develop NMSC were identified: age 60 years, skin type (Fitzpatrick 1 and 2), and load of immunosuppression. NFAT-regulated gene expression was significantly lower in patients who developed NMSCs compared to patients without NMSCs (8.3+/-6.5 vs. 12.7+/-12.8%, p<0.001). Squamous cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis were significantly associated with a high inhibition of IL-2 and IFNgamma. Patients with basal cell carcinoma and Bowen disease showed a general low expression of NFAT-regulated gene expression. However, in patients with kerato-acanthoma no significant inhibition of NFAT-regulated gene expression could be detected. Conclusion(s): The immunosuppressive load contributed to the risk of NMSCs. NFATregulated gene expression was significantly inhibited in patients developing NMSCs. Monitoring of NFAT-regulated gene expression in CNI treated transplant recipients provides an individual profile of response to CNIs and is a useful tool for an individual immunosuppression with respect to safety and toxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in under-developed countries. Human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18 are the most prevalent types associated with carcinogenesis in the cervix. Conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), type-specific and consensus primer-based PCR followed by sequencing, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) or hybridization by specific probes are common methods for HPV detection and typing. In addition, some researchers have developed a multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection and typing of different HPVs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of HPV infection and its types in cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) using the Nested Multiplex PCR (NMPCR) assay. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six samples with histologically confirmed SCC were evaluated. Total DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Nested multiplex PCR was performed with first-round PCR by GP-E6/E7 consensus primers for amplification of the genomic DNA of all known mucosal HPV genotypes and second-round PCR by type-specific multiplex PCR primer cocktails. RESULTS: Human papilloma virus infection was detected in 78.8% of samples, with the highest prevalence of HPV 16 (60.6%) while concurrent infections with two types was detected in 10.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The NMPCR assay is more convenient and easy for analysis of results, which is important for fast diagnosis and patient management, in a type-specific manner.

AB  - Background: In compliance with national and international guidelines, non-pregnant women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 should be treated by cervical conization. According to the definition of the large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) operation, the lesion needs to be resected, including the transformation zone. It is well known from the literature that the cone size directly correlates with the risk of preterm delivery in the course of a future pregnancy. Thus, it would be highly desirable to keep the cone dimension as small as possible while maintaining the same level of oncological safety. Methods/Design: The aim of this study is to analyze whether resection of the lesion only, without additional excision of the transformation zone, is equally as effective as the classical LLETZ operation regarding oncological outcome. We are performing this prospective, patient-blinded multicenter trial by randomly assigning women who need to undergo a LLETZ operation for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 to either of the following two groups at a ratio of 1:1: (1) additional resection of the transformation zone or (2) resection of the lesion only. To evaluate equal oncological outcome, we are performing human papillomavirus (HPV) tests 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The study is designed to consider the lesion-only operation as oncologically not inferior if the rate of HPV high-risk test results is not higher than 5 % compared with the HPV high-risk rate of women undergoing the classical LLETZ operation. Discussion(s): In case that non-inferiority of the "lesion-only" method can be demonstrated, this operation should eventually become standard treatment for all women at childbearing age due to the reduction in risk of preterm delivery.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the cost-effectiveness of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing using a hrHPV DNA and a hrHPV messenger RNA (mRNA) assay under current US cervical cancer screening guidelines. Method(s): We constructed a Markov model for stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis using published data. We compared screening efficiency using DNA and mRNA testing for the following: (1) cotesting with cytology in women 30 to 65 years, and (2) triage of women with mild cervical cytological abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US]) in the United States. Screening end point is histologically confirmed high-grade lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or invasive cancer). Sensitivity and specificity estimates of DNA and mRNA testing to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or invasive cancer were obtained from 2 published trials: the US Clinical Evaluation of APTIMA mRNA (CLEAR) study for ASC-US triage and the French APTIMA Screening Evaluation (FASE) study for cotesting. Costs of DNA and mRNA testing were assumed identical. Costs of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical neoplasia and cancer were from previously published estimates, adjusted to 2012 US dollars. Inputs were modeled as distributions for Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model outcomes were costs per life-year saved for each strategy, discounted at 3% annually. Result(s): For both cotesting and ASC-US triage, mRNA testing cost less than DNA testing, whereas life expectancies were widely overlapping. There was a 100% probability that DNA testing was not cost-effective at $100,000/life-year saved threshold for ASC-US triage and a 55% probability that DNA testing was not cost-effective at the same threshold for cotesting. Conclusion(s): Based on the available evidence, mRNA testing for cotesting or ASC-US triage is likely to be more efficient than DNA testing under current US cervical cancer screening guidelines.Copyright © 2015 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective To examine the effect of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, on the disease course of patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Methods A retrospective chart review of patients with RRP was conducted and 20 patients were selected who had received the Gardasil vaccine as part of their treatment. Efficacy was assessed by calculating the intersurgical interval (ISI) before and after receiving the vaccine, as well as number of complete and partial remissions. Results Analysis of all patients found a significant increase in the ISI of 3.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-5.19, P = 0.0061). Male patients experienced an increase in the ISI of 4.2 months (95% CI: 1.6-6.7, P = 0.0048). Female patients had a nonsignificant increase in ISI of 1.2 months (95% CI: 3.1-5.4, P = 0.51). Eight patients (40%; six male and two female) experienced complete remission. Five patients (25%) overall (three male and two female) experienced partial remission. In total, complete or partial remission was achieved in a total of 13 (65%) patients (nine male and four female). Conclusions The Gardasil vaccine can modulate the severity of RRP and induce remission in some patients. The effect was much greater in males and in females in low estrogen states.Copyright © 2015 The Voice Foundation.

AB  - Background: The identification of suited early detection tests is one among the multiple requirements to reduce cervical cancer incidence in developing countries. Method(s): We evaluated p16INK4a/Ki-67 dual-stain cytology in a screening population in Thika district, Kenya and compared it to high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA testing and visual inspection by acetic acid (VIA) and Lugol's iodine (VILI). Result(s): Valid results for all tests could be obtained in 477 women. 20.9 % (100/477) were tested positive for HR-HPV DNA, 3.1 % (15/477) had positive VIA/VILI and 8.2 % (39/477) positive p16INK4a/Ki-67 cytology. Of 22 women that showed up for colposcopy and biopsy, 6 women were diagnosed with CIN3 and two with CIN2. All women with CIN2/3 were negative in VIA/VILI screening and positive by HR-HPV DNA testing. But HPV was also positive in 91.7 % (11/12) of women with normal histology. p16INK4a/Ki-67 cytology was positive in all 6 women with CIN3, in one of the two CIN2 and in only 8.3 % (1/12) of women with normal histology. Conclusion(s): p16INK4a/Ki-67 cytology is an interesting test for further studies in developing countries, since our findings point to a lower fraction of false positive test results using p16INK4a/Ki-67 cytology compared to HPV DNA testing in a Kenyan screening population. VIA/VILI missed all histology-proven CIN2/3.Copyright © 2015 Ngugi et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Xpert HPV Assay (Xpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was developed for the multianalytic GeneXpert platform. METHODS: In a colposcopy referral population of 708 women living in the United States, two cervical specimens, A and B, were collected, and both were tested by the Xpert assay for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA, permitting an evaluation of its test reliability. Specimen B was also tested by Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and the cobas HPV Test (cobas; Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA). RESULTS: The kappa and percent agreement for any hrHPV for the two Xpert results were 0.88 and 94.5%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in testing positive on both specimens by Xpert (P = .62). The sensitivity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) was 89.0% using specimen A and 90.4% using specimen B for Xpert, 90.4% for cobas, and 81.6% for hc2. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert assay was sensitive and reliable for the detection of hrHPV and the identification of women with CIN2+.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cervical screening guidelines now recommend repeat cotesting of patients aged 30 years and older having a human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 1 year as preferred management. Only limited follow-up data on patients with HPV-negative LSILs are available from routine US clinical practice settings. METHODS: In total, 680 patients with Hybrid Capture 2 (Qiagen, Hinden, Germany) high-risk HPV-negative LSIL ThinPrep (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) results were identified. Patients' ages and histopathologic, cytologic, and HPV follow-up results were identified. RESULTS: Among 680 patients with HPV-negative LSILs, 468 had follow-up within 1 year. During the study period, 14 (3.0%) of 468 had follow-up high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 184 (39.3%) LSIL findings. No diagnoses of cervical carcinoma were documented. There were no significant follow-up differences between age groups. Of the 321 patients who had follow-up HPV testing, 271 (84.4%) had negative and 50 (15.6%) had positive HPV results. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study documenting follow-up results for patients with HPV-negative LSIL results based on prevalent US FDA-approved co-testing methods from one collection vial. These data document that risk for follow-up HSILs in these patients is low and also that no cervical cancers were diagnosed. These findings support recent recommendations for repeat co-testing after 1 year as an appropriate option for patients with HPV-negative LSIL results.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of HPV DNA in females aged 30-65 years who presented for scanning at Eskisehir Training Centre for Early Cancer Diagnosis and Scanning (KETEM) and to research the effect of potential risk factors on HPV DNA positivity. Method(s): The study comprised 1081 females aged 30-65 years who presented for scanning at Eskisehir Training Centre for Early Cancer Diagnosis and Scanning (KETEM). All participants completed a questionnaire with demographic information and data on potential risk factors then cervical smear samples were taken according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The testing to determine the presence of HPV DNA in the samples was applied at the Microbiology Laboratory of Eskisehir Osmanagazi University Medical Faculty using the Hybrid Capture 2 kit (HC 2: Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The SPSS 20.0 statistical software was used for the molecular method results and the statistical analysis of the questionnaire data. Result(s): The high risk and low risk subjects included in the study were examined separately for the presence of HPV. In a total of 32 samples (3.0%), HPV was determined to be present with the HC 2 test. In the statistical analysis of the results of a survey applied to the participants for evaluating the risk factors; significant effection HPV DNA positivity was determined on the variables such as, a higher number of births, protection with oral contraception (OCS) method and smoking. Conclusion(s): In addition to the prevention of cervical cancer, scanning programs are also important in protection against HPV infection. Applications which could be implemented on this subject can be considered as defining the potential risk factors and taking precautions against them. More detailed studies should be conducted in Turkey to research the relationship between HPV infections and social groups, the frequency of HPV infection, results, follow-up, treatment, control and prevention. Communities must be made aware of this subject through public health education.Copyright © GATA.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: The EXTREME regimen (6 cycles of 5FU- cisplatin-cetuximab followed by cetuximab maintenance) is currently the standard of care in first line recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The GORTEC phase II trial evaluating the TPEx regimen (4 cycles of docetaxel-cisplatin-cetuximab followed by cetuximab maintenance) demonstrated good results (median overall survival (OS) 14 months, overall response rate 54%) with acceptable safety profile, excellent dose intensity, high rate of patients who started maintenance and easy implementation. The aim of the current trial is to compare TPEx and EXTREME regimens. Material(s) and Method(s): International, randomized, openlabel trial. Main inclusion criteria are: histologically confirmed HNSCC with metastasis or recurrence not suitable for locoregional treatment, age 18-70 years, PS 60 ml/min, prior total dose of cisplatin < 300 mg/m2. The control arm EXTREME consists of 6 cycles, every 21 days, of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day1, 5FU 4000 mg/m2 continuous infusion day1-4, and weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2) followed by weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m2 maintenance. The experimental arm TPEx consists of 4 cycles, every 21 days, of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day1, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day1, and weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2), followed by maintenance cetuximab 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. If cisplatin is not tolerated or when the total cumulative dose reaches 600 mg/m2, it must be replaced by carboplatin AUC5. Prophylactic administration of G-CSF must be done systematically after each chemotherapy cycle in the TPEx arm. Cetuximab maintenance is given only in patients with at least disease stabilization and is continued until PD or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is OS. Assuming a 2-sided type I error of 0.05, observing 295 deaths will provide a 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.72. 295 deaths are expected out of a total of 416 patients. Secondary endpoints are objective response rate, best response rate, PFS, time-to-progression, toxicity and quality of life. Tumor response assessments are planned every 6 weeks until week18, then every 8 weeks until progression and will be reviewed by a blinded central image review committee. HPV central analysis and cost-effectiveness study are ancillary studies. 75 sites in France (GORTEC), Germany (AIO-Studien-gGmbH) and Spain (TTCC) will participate in the trial. Patients are randomized between the 2 arms (1:1) by minimization on PS, type of evolution, previous cetuximab treatment and country. Result(s): The first patient has been enrolled in October 2014. Results are expected by the end of 2017. Conclusion(s): This randomized trial will establish if TPEx regimen is a relevant substitute for EXTREME as 1st line treatment in fit patients with R/M HNSCC.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate HPV16 E6 gene mutations and P53 codon72 polymorphism in women diagnosed as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3. Method(s): A total of 112 exfoliated cervical cell specimens which were HPV16 positive from women in Beijing in China were included. These cases were divided into group 1 (normal and CIN1, 55 cases) and group 2 (CIN2 and 3, 57 cases) according to pathological diagnosis. Full-length HPV E6 gene was successfully amplified from 85 specimens by PCR with E6 specific primers, and the PCR products were sequenced directly and compared with a German standard strain. P53 codon72 region was also amplified from the 112 specimens with specifically-designed primers, and the PCR products were sequenced directly and compared with the standard sequence. Result(s): Seventy out of 85 cases had HPV16 E6 point mutation. T178G was the most common mutation of HPV16 E6. The rate of T178G in CIN 2 and 3 cases was significantly higher than that in normal and CIN1 cases. The 112 cases of P53 codon72 sequences showed that there were more cases with Pro/Pro genotype in group of CIN2 and 3 than that in group of normal and CIN1. According to the calculated OR value, the risk of CIN2 and 3 in cases with either Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro was 10-times lower than that with Pro/Pro. Conclusion(s): HPV16 E6 T178G mutation significantly related to CIN2 and 3 and may be a risk factor for CIN2 and 3. The risk for CIN2 and 3 of Pro/Pro genotype was much higher than that of Arg/Arg and Arg/Pro genotypes.

If cisplatin is not tolerated or its total cumulative dose reaches 600 mg/m2, it must be replaced by carboplatin AUC5. G-CSF prophylactic administration is mandatory for each cycle in the TPEx arm. Only patients with CR/PR/SD will continue the cetuximab maintenance until PD or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is OS. Assuming a 2-sided type I error of 0.05, observing 295 deaths will provide a 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.72. 295 deaths are expected out of 416 patients (208 per arm). Secondary endpoints are ORR, best response rate, PFS, TTP, toxicity and QoL. Tumor response assessments (Weeks 6, 12 and 18, then every 8 weeks until PD) will be reviewed by a blinded central image review committee.

AB  - Background: The genetic landscape of SCCHN is currently being unravelled, but the role of distinct mutations for treatment outcome remains largely unknown. We compared mutational patterns of HPV+ and HPV- tumors with outcome after uniform chemoradiation. Method(s): Archival tumor specimens from 208 patients with carcinomas of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity, all uniformly treated with surgery and adjuvant cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy, were included in this study. An in-house gene panel for semiconductor- based next-generation ultra-deep sequencing, covering 211 exons from 45 genes frequently altered in SCCHN was used for mutational analysis. Genetic alterations were correlated with HPV status and patient outcome. Result(s): Mutational profiles were successfully established for 185 SCCHN cases. Interestingly, HPV+ carcinomas were significantly enriched for activating mutations in driver genes (PIK3CA 27%, KRAS 8%,NRAS 4%, HRAS 2%) compared to HPV- cases (P = 0.002). Conversely, HPV- tumors showed an increased frequency of loss-of-function alterations in tumor suppressor genes (TP53 67%, CDKN2A 30%, PTEN 4%, SMAD4 3%) compared to HPV+ cases (P < 0.001). After a median follow- up of 55 months, alterations in tumor suppressor genes significantly increased the risk of death (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.8, P = 0.001), locoregional recurrence (HR 5.4, 95% CI 1.6-18.1, P = 0.006) and distant metastasis (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.1, P = 0.04). The occurrence of activating driver gene mutations did not influence outcome in the total cohort of patients; however, they were associated per trend with increased risk of locoregional recurrence and death (HR 3.7, 95% CI 0.7-20.6, P = 0.12) in HPV+ oropharyngeal carcinomas. Conclusion(s): Overall, loss-of-function tumor suppressor gene mutations negatively interfere with efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, whereas activating driver gene mutations define poor risk specifically in HPV-driven SCCHN. These genes and their signalling pathways might represent therapeutic targets for improving cure rates of SCCHN.

AB  - Objective: To validate the impact of HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and tumour hypoxia status in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received postoperative radiotherapy. The results of the exploration cohort have previously been reported by the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG; Lohaus et al., 2014; Linge et al., 2016). Material(s) and Method(s): For 152 patients with locally advanced HNSCC the impact of HPV16 DNA status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of postoperative radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. Out of them, 40 patients received postoperative radiochemotherapy. Cox models presented in a previous study were validated using the concordance index as a performance measure. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control. Results were compared to those previously reported by DKTK-ROG. Result(s): Loco-regional control, freedom from distant metastases and overall survival were inferior to the previously reported cohort. Despite of this, the prognostic value of the combination of HPV infection status, CSC marker expression (SLC3A2) and tumour hypoxia status could be validated in univariate analyses using an independent validation cohort. For multivariate models, the concordance index was between 0.58 and 0.69 in validation, indicating a good prognostic performance of the models. The inclusion of CD44 and the 15-gene hypoxia signature moderately improved the performance compared to a baseline model without CSC markers or hypoxia classifiers. Conclusion(s): The HPV status, CSC marker expression of CD44 and SLC3A2 as well as hypoxia status are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated by postoperative radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 The Authors

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) load has been linked to cellular abnormalities of the uterine cervix, and proposed as predictors of HPV persistence and progression of dysplasia to cervical cancer. However, the association of HPV viral load and anal dysplasia and cancer has not been as thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of the viral loads of high-risk HPV types 16, 18, and 52, with the cytologic severity grading in anal-swab specimens of MSM with and without HIV-1 co-infection. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study recruited 200 MSM in northern Thailand from July 2012 to January 2013. Real-time qPCR amplified portion of the HPV E6E7 gene, as well as the human beta-globin gene to validate adequacy of the anal specimens and to normalize interpatient viral-load comparisons. Genotyping by linear-array assay identified and distinguished types 16, 18, and 52. RESULTS: HPV-16, and -18 viral loads increased with respect to the abnormality of the cytologic diagnoses (p<0.05 for HPV-16, p<0.01 for HPV-18). HIV-1 positivity was associated with higher HPV-18 viral load (p=0.006). HPV-16 viral loads >/=10(2.24) copies per 5000 anal cells, and HPV-18 loads >/=10(3.15), were independently associated with abnormal cytology on logistic regression (p=0.022, p=0.041, respectively). Positive predictive values were 85.2% (23/27) and 80.0% (44/55) for the high viral load of a particular HPV-16 and the combined HPV-16, -18 and -52 types, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High viral loads of HPV types 16 and 18 appear to be associated with anal cytologic abnormalities. The clinical utility of HPV viral loads to predict risk for anal cancer remains to be determined by a larger prospective cohort with sufficient frequency of high-grade dysplasia.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate how often distant metastases occur in localized oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). The investigators hypothesize that abdominal sonography and chest X-ray may not be necessary for initial staging of early oral squamous cell carcinoma in UICC stage I/II. Material and methods The investigators implemented a retrospective study. The study collective was composed of 124 patients with OSCC, who were treated in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery during the years 2011-2015 at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Germany. We focused on age, gender, date of diagnosis, tumour stage (clinical and pathological), HPV status, occurrence of metastases, recurrences, date and frequency of staging and restaging (abdominal sonography, chest X-ray, CT Abdomen/Thorax, PET CT), follow up time and date of death. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed (chi-square test) and the P value was set at.05. Results 19 distant metastases were found in 13 out of 124 patients (10.48%). Of those 20 metastases 5 were found in the liver (26.32%), 11 in the lung (57.89%) and 4 in the bone (15.79%). Hepatic metastases co-occurred in every case with pulmonary metastases. In one case bone metastases occurred without the presence of pulmonary metastases. There was no significant correlation of metastasis rate to T stage. But distant metastases were solely found in node positive patients. This was significant for pulmonary metastases, not for liver metastases. Only one out of 11 pulmonary metastases was diagnosed by chest X-ray. Conclusion Abdominal sonography and chest X-ray can be omitted as a standard procedure in staging of localized node negative oral squamous cell carcinoma. A thoracic CT including the liver should be performed in patients with suspected lymph nodes metastases in the neck on CT. A skeletal scintigraphy or alternatively a PET/PET-CT should be added if there are signs and symptoms suspicious for bone metastases.Copyright © 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a commercially available test to detect E6/E7 mRNA of 14 subtypes of high-risk HPVs (APTIMA; Hologic, Bedford, MA) in the sentinel lymph nodes of CC patients laparoscopically operated. DESIGN: Prospective pilot study. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Department of Advanced Operative and Oncologic Gynecology, Asklepios Hospital, Hamburg, Germany. PATIENTS: 54 women with HPV-positive CC submitted to laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy alone or sentinel node biopsy followed by systematic pelvic and/or para-aortic endoscopic lymphadenectomy. INTERVENTIONS: All removed sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) underwent sample collection by cytobrush for the APTIMA assay before frozen section. MEASUREMENTS: Results obtained with the HPV mRNA test were compared with the definitive histopathological analysis of the SLNs and additional lymph nodes removed. RESULTS: A total of 125 SLNs (119 pelvic and 6 paraaortic) were excised with a mean number of 2.3 SLNs per patient. Final histopathologic analysis confirmed nodal metastases in 10 SLNs from 10 different patients (18%). All the histologically confirmed metastatic lymph nodes were also HPV E6/E7 mRNA positive, resulting in a sensitivity of 100%. Four histologically free sentinel nodes were positive for HPV E6/E7 mRNA, resulting in a specificity of 96.4%. CONCLUSION: The HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay in the SLNs of patients with CC is feasible and highly accurate. The detection of HPV mRNA in 4 women with negative SLNs might denote a shift from microscopic identification of metastasis to the molecular level. The prognostic value of this findings awaits further verification.

AB  - Background Health technology assessments (HTAs) are increasingly used to inform coverage, access, and utilization of medical technologies including molecular diagnostics (MDx). Although MDx are used to screen patients and inform disease management and treatment decisions, there is no uniform approach to their evaluation by HTA organizations. Objectives The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group reviewed diagnostic-specific HTA programs and identified elements representing common and best practices. Methods MDx-specific HTA programs in Europe, Australia, and North America were characterized by methodology, evaluation framework, and impact. Published MDx HTAs were reviewed, and five representative case studies of test evaluations were developed: United Kingdom (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's Diagnostics Assessment Programme, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase mutation), United States (Palmetto's Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, OncotypeDx prostate cancer test), Germany (Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare, human papillomavirus testing), Australia (Medical Services Advisory Committee, anaplastic lymphoma kinase testing for non-small cell lung cancer), and Canada (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Rapid Response: Non-invasive Prenatal Testing). Results Overall, the few HTA programs that have MDx-specific methods do not provide clear parameters of acceptability related to clinical and analytic performance, clinical utility, and economic impact. The case studies highlight similarities and differences in evaluation approaches across HTAs in the performance metrics used (analytic and clinical validity, clinical utility), evidence requirements, and how value is measured. Not all HTAs are directly linked to reimbursement outcomes. Conclusions To improve MDx HTAs, organizations should provide greater transparency, better communication and collaboration between industry and HTA stakeholders, clearer links between HTA and funding decisions, explicit recognition of and rationale for differential approaches to laboratory-developed versus regulatory-approved test, and clear evidence requirements.Copyright © 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually-transmitted virus and it is known that persistent infection by high-risk HPV is a necessary factor for cervical carcinogenesis. Although cytological screening has decreased the incidence of cervical cancer, the sensitivity and specificity of testing is limited. To date, HPV-driven molecular techniques have provided a number of potential biomarkers for both diagnostic and prognostic use in clinical management. In addition, they can provide insights into the biology of HPV-induced cancers leading to non-surgical therapy. This review summarizes current knowledge of detection methods for HPV and related biomarkers that can be used to discriminate lesions with a high risk of progression of cervical cancer.Copyright © 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

AB  - Increasing attendance to screening offers the best potential for improving the effectiveness of well-established cervical cancer screening programs. Self-sampling at home for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as an alternative to a clinical sampling can be a useful policy to increase attendance. To determine whether self-sampling improves screening attendance for women who do not regularly attend the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Programme (NCCSP), 800 women aged 25'69 years in the Oslo area who were due to receive a 2nd reminder to attend regular screening were randomly selected and invited to be part of the intervention group. Women in this group received one of two self-sampling devices, Evalyn Brush or Delphi Screener. To attend screening, women in the intervention group had the option of using the self-sampling device (self-sampling subgroup) or visiting their physician for a cervical smear. Self-sampled specimens were split and analyzed for the presence of high-risk (hr) HPV by the CLART1HPV2 test and the digene1Hybrid Capture (HC)2 test. The control group consisted of 2593 women who received a 2nd reminder letter according to the current guidelines of the NCCSP. The attendance rates were 33.4% in the intervention group and 23.2%in the control group, with similar attendance rates for both self-sampling devices. Women in the self-sampling subgroup responded favorably to both self-sampling devices and cited not remembering receiving a call for screening as the most dominant reason for previous non-attendance. Thirty-two of 34 (94.1%) hrHPV-positive women in the self-sampling subgroup attended follow-up. In conclusion, self-sampling increased attendance rates and was feasible and well received. This study lends further support to the proposal that self-sampling may be a valuable alternative for increasing cervical cancer screening coverage in Norway.Copyright © 2016 Enerly et al.

AB  - Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most frequent neoplasia among women worldwide. Cancer prevention programs around the world have used the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear as the primary diagnostic test to reduce the burden of CC. Nevertheless, such programs have not been effective in developing countries, thus leading to research on alternative tests for CC screening. During the virus life cycle and in the process toward malignancy, different human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins are expressed, and they induce a host humoral immune response that can be used as a potential marker for different stages of the disease. We present a new Slot blot assay to detect serum antibodies against HPV16 E4, E7, and VLPs-L1 antigens. The system was validated with sera from a female population (n=485) aged 18 to 64 years referred to the dysplasia clinic at the General Hospital in Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico. To evaluate the clinical performance of the serological markers, the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and receiver-operating characteristic curves (for antibodies alone or in combination) were calculated in groups of lesions of increasing severity. The results showed high prevalence of anti-E4 (73%) and anti-E7 (80%) antibodies in the CC group. Seropositivity to 1, 2, or 3 antigens showed associations of increasing magnitude with CC (odds ratio [OR]=12.6, 19.9, and 58.5, respectively). The highest association with CC was observed when the analysis was restricted to only anti-E4+E7 antibodies (OR=187.7). The best clinical performance to discriminate CC from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 to 3 was the one for the combination of anti-E4 and/or anti-E7 antibodies, which displayed high sensitivity (93.3%) and moderate specificity (64.1%), followed by anti-E4 and anti-E7 antibodies (73.3% and 80%; 89.6% and 66%, respectively). In addition, the sensitivity of anti-E4 and/or anti-E7 antibodies is high at any time of sexual activity (TSA), which suggests they can be biomarkers for the early detection of CC. The sensitivity of anti-E4 antibodies was low (<10%) when the TSA was <10 years, and it increased up to 100% in relation to the TSA, suggesting that anti-E4 antibodies can be useful as HPV exposure markers at early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Prior screening results in women diagnosed with cervical carcinoma are only reported in the literature in small numbers. We wish to examine a larger number of prior testing results in women with cervical carcinoma from China to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of Pap (Papanicolaou) cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Material(s) and Method(s): In our study, 178 patients with histologically diagnosed cervical carcinoma and Pap cytology and/or HPV testing in the year prior to diagnosis were retrospectively studied. Pap cytology was performed using liquid-based preparations and HPV testing was done with mostly Hybrid Capture 2 but also included other methods. Result(s): In our study, 82.0% of women were symptomatic at presentation with vaginal bleeding or abnormal vaginal discharge. HPV testing was negative in 9.8% of women in the short period before diagnosis of cervical cancer and Pap cytology had a higher rate of false negative results at 16.7%. Adenocarcinoma showed a higher negative testing rate than squamous cell carcinoma did with both cytology and HPV testing. Only 1 of 78 patients (1.3%) having both tests showed a double negative result. Negative high-risk HPV testing was noted in 2 of 9 squamous cell carcinoma patients with routine gynecological examination. Conclusion(s): Both Pap cytology and HPV testing have higher rates of prior negative results in women with cervical carcinoma. When testing is performed using both methods, the greatest number of cervical carcinomas can be detected. These results should also be considered when making screening recommendations with the understanding that HPV testing alone will miss at least a proportion of women with incident cervical carcinoma.Copyright © 2016 American Society of Cytopathology.

AB  - Background: Human papillomaviruses have been established as a risk factor for invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix. HPV DNA detection, provides an efficient method of screening. Detection of the HPV E6/E7 oncogene expression emerged as a promising biomarker to determine the risk for the progression to high-grade cervical lesions. In the present study, we aimed to determine the genotypes of HPV DNA positive and mRNA negative samples from our previous study. Material(s) and Method(s): HPV mRNA and DNA detection in samples with abnormal cytology were evaluated in our previous study. Cervical specimens were obtained at Hacettepe University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology via cervical brushes during January-October 2011. Real-time PCR (Heliosis Human Papilloma Virus LC PCR Kit, Metis Biotechnology, Turkey) and NASBA assay (NucliSENS EasyQ HPV v1.1, bioMerieux, France) were performed to detect HPV DNA and E6/E7 mRNA, respectively. In house PCR method was used for genotyping of HPV type 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45 and detection of E6/7 gene with PCR master mix (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), PGMY (Metis Biotechnology, Turkey) and E6/E7 consensus primers (Heliks Biotechnology, Turkey). The primer sequences were controlled in BioEdit 3.0 programme comparing withHPVreference strains. Confirmation of the samples was done by 'Line Probe Assay' (INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Amp, Innogenetics, Belgium). Result(s): Totally 81 women with abnormal cytology result constituted the previous study group. HPV DNA was identified in 73 samples (90.1%) that comprise HPV-16 in 46 samples (63.1%), HPV other than 16 in 15 samples (20.5%) and mixed HPV infections in 12 samples (16.4%). HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression was observed in 45 samples (55.6%). Towards these results, we tried to determine the genotypes of 28 HPVmRNAnegative-type 16DNApositive samples and 15 HPV DNA other than type 16 positive samples; totally 43 samples were tested. Among the 43 samples, 5(12%) samples were detected positive with E6/E7 consensus primers. Four of them were HPV-16 and 1 was HPV genotype other than 16. PCR with positive controls which belongs to genotypes 18, 31, 33, 39 and 45 were carried out. All positive controls worked except HPV-33. Therefore, a new primer for HPV-33 (TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany) was designed and used. However, it did not work again, although it was tested in several PCR conditions. Beside this, all 43 samples were negative for genotypes 18, 31, 35, 39 and 45. Therefore, confirmation of the samples was further done by using LiPA. Totally 12 samples were tested by LiPA. Genotypes detected by LiPA were in 8 cases different from that investigated by PCR (6, 11, 16, 43, 53, 62, 81, 89). Two samples were identified as HPV-33 and two others as HPV-39 by LIPA. However, in none of these 4 samples, these HPV genotypes could be detected by PCR. Because of the limited amount of sample material we could not test all samples by LiPA. Conclusion(s): As a result, depending on LiPA findings, it seems that a number of samples investigated were detected negative by PCR because they had genotypes other than genotypes 18, 31, 35, 39 and 45. Beside this, LiPA amplifies a 65-bp region, and its sensitivity thus might be higher than our PCR method which amplifies 238-bp and 455-bp long regions. Also the E6/E7 gene region is not as conserved as the L1 gene region therefore it is possible to obtain more negative results with E6/E7 PCR.

AB  - Objective: Determining the E6 and E7 carcinogenic proteins caused by various HPV sub-types, and investigating their effects on cervical dysplasia. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy seven patients who were 21 years old or over, and whose smear results were reported as ASCUS, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL and AGC were included in the study. In order to determine the HPV DNA and the HPV types, the HPV sign Q24 Complete Kit, the Rotor- Gene and PyroMark Q24 (Qiagen, Germany) systems were used. Then, by using the NucliSENS EasyQ Genetic Analyzer device (Biomerieux, France), and utilizing the NASBA Method, the existence of E6 and E7 gene expression in HPV DNA positive samples was investigated with total fragment analysis method. The SPSS 22.0 Program was used in statistical analyses. Result(s): When the HPV DNA was investigated in 77 cases (100%) who had abnormal sitology it was observed that in 22 (28,6%) cases the HPV DNA was positive, and in 55 (71,4%) cases the HPV DNA was negative. In 22 HPV DNA positive cases, the HPV E6/E7 mRNA was investigated; 8 cases were ASCUS and 3 (37,5%) cases had positive E6/E7 mRNA, 4 cases were ASC-H and 3 (75%) cases had positive E6/E7 mRNA, 8 cases were LGSIL and 4 (50%) had positive E6/E7 mRNA, 2 cases were HGSIL and 1 (50%) had positive E6/E7 mRNA. Discussion(s): In our study, it has been determined that there is a direct relation between the increasing positivity rate of the HPV E6/E7 mRNA gen expression and the frequency of cervical dysplasia. This rate was determined as being statistically significant.

AB  - Purpose or Objective: To retrospectively assess the prognostic value of the potential biomarkers, i.e. chemokine receptor CXCR4, its ligand CXCL12 (SDF1), and nuclear EGFR expression in a cohort of 201 patients with locally advanced HNSCC. Patients were treated between 2005 and 2011 in 8 German cancer centers, as part of a multicenter biomarker study of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG). Experimental data and first clinical observations suggest that activation of CXCR4 and SDF1 signaling pathway and nuclear location of EGFR are implicated in tumour cell proliferation, cellular survival, tumour progression, worse overall survival, metastasis and enhanced treatment resistance in different tumour types. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with locally advanced SCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx were treated with resection and adjuvant RT and Cisplatin-based CT. Tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) were generated from surgical specimens and evaluated for the expression of the biomarkers by immunofluorescence with a semi-quantative method, based on their cellular location (membranous, intracellular, nuclear), extent of expression on TMA area and staining intensity. The results of the biomarker analysis along with the clinical parameters were then correlated with the clinical outcome. Result(s): In univariate analysis, tumours with either SDF1 or CXCR4 intracellular overexpression displayed a significant negative correlation with loco-regional control (LCR) (HR: 2.52, p=0.01 and HR: 1.96, p=0.05 respectively). No correlation was observed for the nuclear expression of EGFR (HR: 0.85, p= 0.67), membranous expression of SDF1 (p=0.73) or CXCR4 (p=0.38). Tumours with intracellular co-expression of both SDF1 and CXCR4 were significantly correlated with poor LRC (HR: 2.72, p=0.01). Previously published data from the same cohort, showed that absence of p16 (negative HPV status) was correlating with poor LRC. Importantly, increased expression of SDF1 or co-expression with CXCR4 could identify a group of patients with significantly worse outcome within the HPV negative group (p=0.01). Multivariate cox regression analysis including HPV status, tumour localisation, tumour volume and the respective biomarkers indicated a significant independent role of SDF1 (HR: 2.20, p=0.04) and co-expression with CXCR4 (HR: 2.19, p=0.05) on LRC. Conclusion(s): In summary, pre-treatment overexpression of CXCR4/SDF1 is an independent negative prognostic factor for the outcome of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who receive surgery and standard RT-CT. Further investigation in a cohort of patient receiving primary RT-CT and a prospective validation study is currently ongoing. SDF1/CXCR4 appears to be a promising biomarker for treatment individualization, in particular in HPV negative advanced HNSCC patients and supports strategies using drugable targets against this pathway to enhance efficacy of standard treatment.

AB  - Background The incidence of cervical cancer in Germany remains high in relation to other countries in Western Europe. Possible reasons for this include low participation in cervical cancer screening (CCS) and low quality of cytology. Germany currently does not have an organized CCS program and screening efforts with the Pap smear remain opportunistic. The TeQaZ study is a case control study investigating participation in CCS and evaluating the quality of cytology. The aim of this analysis was to investigate differences with regards to frequency of participation in CCS and other risk factors between women who developed cervical cancer and healthy controls. Methods Incident cases of cervical cancer, diagnosed between 2012 and 2016 in Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate and surrounding regions, were recruited. Cases were matched with three population-based controls, recruited via population registers, based on age and region of residence. Cases and controls completed a telephone interview regarding frequency of CCS participation during the past ten years. Various socio-demographic and other risk factors were assessed. Univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to model the probability of developing cervical cancer. Results A total of more than 200 cases and 600 controls were included in the study and successfully completed the study questionnaire. Univariable logistic regression showed that women who participated in CCS less frequently were more likely to develop cervical cancer than women who participated more frequently. Additionally, findings from multivariable logistic regression adjusting for factors potentially associated with the development of cervical cancer will be presented. These factors include smoking, number of children, number of sexual partners, use of oral contraceptives and other sociodemographic factors. Conclusion The findings of the TeQaZ study regarding frequency of participation in CCS make an important contribution towards the development of an evidence-based, organized CCS program in Germany. Such an organized program should include population-based invitations to attend screening at appropriate intervals, with high quality cytology and HPV testing for the appropriate age groups.

AB  - Background It should be the aim to protect women from a carcinoma of the cervix and its preliminary stages with a type specific vaccination. Half of all women develop barely or not antibodies against HPV. A possible advancement of the HPV vaccination with antibody-titer-identification could be a sensible support for women with HPV infection. Furthermore the continuing care, education and invitation for vaccinated women to take part in gynecological screening with morphological diagnostics apply. Methods During microscopic inspection of gynecological cells of the cervix of vaccinated women between the ages of 18 and 26 using the known malignancy criteria, mild, moderate and sever dysplasia as classified in the Munchner Nomenklatur III in German-speaking areas, can be detected. Results From January 2015 to January 2016 27 cases of dysplasia of the cervix in Pap smears of vaccinated women were diagnosed. 59 % of these cases were vaccinated with Gardasil, in 41 % the vaccine wasn't specified. The dysplasia show the following distribution: 63 % of cases show a mild dysplasia (low SIL). In 37 % a high SIL lesion can be verified. Thereof 33 % have a moderate dysplasia and 4 % a severe dysplasia. Development and progress of the dysplasia: in 74 % of cases the year of vaccination is unknown. In 7 % of cases a dysplasia shows after 1 year, in 4 % after 4 years and in 15 % after 5 years of HPV vaccination. There are 70 % of cases in dysplasia follow-up examinations, 15 % of these are healed up within 2 years. In 15 % of high SIL cases a histological clarification followed, which confirmed the high SIL lesion 100 %. Conclusion The actual rate before the formation of a dysplasia in vaccinated women to the rate of formation of a dysplasia in non-vaccinated women, cannot be illustrated at the moment. At this particular time there is no valid specific marginal limit for a HPV-antibody-titeridentification and also a subtype determination of HPV antibodies isn't possible, that's why a reliable statement about the length of immunity and the actual raising of specific antibodies against HPV isn't possible. The HPV test doesn't indicate dormant HPV infections reliably. The effect of the HPV vaccination into a dormant HPV infection to the actual effect on the formation of a dysplasia is therefore unclear. It can also be observed that further HPV types in high SIL are detected, even though these are not officially classified as high SIL. These HPV types are currently not detected using the common HPV tests and are not included in the new advanced vaccination. If the development of further new high risk HPV types continues it is questionable if a HPV-screening-program can withstand the HPV mutation, while morphological diagnostics are unaffected and malignancy criteria remain consistent. It is through morphological diagnostics such high SIL are detected. Thus the importance of gynecological screening with morphological diagnostics becomes apparent.

AB  - The program for early detection of cervical cancer in Germany will be reorganized over the coming years. According to law, the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss-G-BA) is responsible for establishing the new program protocols. In March 2015, the G-BA published an outline of the planned early detection program [1]. Women younger than 30 years will eligible for an annual pap smear. Women age 30 years and older will be allowed to choose one of two early detection plans. They may opt for an annual pap smear, which reflects the current offering of the statutory health insurances, or an HPV test every five years. Once one plan has been chosen, switching between plans will not be allowed. After at least six years, an evaluation of this choice model should help determine the superiority of one plan over the other. The Cancer Epidemiology working group of the German Society for Epidemiology was invited to a meeting of the G-BA in December 2015 to discuss the planned cervical cancer early detection program and to provide a written statement. The statement highlighted various organizational and methodological shortcomings of the plan, in particular in relation to the comparative evaluation of the two early detection strategies. In this workshop, the opportunities and limits for the evaluation of the planned cervical cancer early detection program in Germany will be presented and discussed. The goal is to exchange ideas across institutions and to lay the groundwork for developing a methodologically sound evaluation plan.

AB  - Background Cervical cancer remains the third most common cancer among women worldwide, with HPV infection being causal for its development. This analysis describes various recruitment strategies for the MARZY study, which investigated cervical cancer screening (CCS) invitation models, reasons for non-participation in CCS and population- based human papillomavirus testing in Germany. Methods The MARZY study is a prospective, population-based cohort study. A sample of women aged 30-65 years, living in the city of Mainz and the rural district of Mainz-Bingen was randomly selected for the study via population registries. During the baseline investigation (2005-2007), women in intervention group were sent a personalized letter of invitation and were asked to make an appointment at an office-based gynecologist of their own choice. Those women who did not respond to the invitation letter were contacted via a first reminder letter, second reminder letter or telephone interview. This analysis investigated the proportion of women participating in the study after each intervention, as well as the time period until study participation. Logistic regressions analyses were performed to investigate associations between study participation and factors such as age, nationality and study region. Results A total of 5 275 women in the intervention group were eligible to participate and received an invitation letter. The proportion of women participating after each intervention, the time period until study participation, as well as factors associated with participation will be reported. Conclusion The findings of this analysis will provide insights into which recruitment strategies are effective in terms of contributing towards a higher response rate when conducting large epidemiological studies.

AB  - Objective: To compare the feasibility of using the self-sampling devices Delphi Screener or Evalyn Brush with HPV genotyping and the low-complexity Arbor Vita OncoE6TM test for cervical cancer screening in low resource settings. Method(s): During 2 pilot studies 400 women (200 HIV+, 200 HR-HPV) were recruited at Catholic Hospital Battor. 250 women (100 HIV+, 150 HR-HPV) collected samples with the Delphi Screener and 150 women (100 HIV+, 50 HR-HPV) with the Evalyn Brush. Cytobrush and swab samples were reference samples. Samples were tested with the Arbor Vita OncoE6TM Cervical test in Ghana and HPV genotyped with GP5+/6+ PCR followed by Luminex-MPG readout at the Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin. Result(s): HPV genotyping for 27 HPV types performed on Delphi Screener samples showed 50% Sensitivity and 99% Specificity compared to the cytobrush sample. Evalyn brush samples revealed 86% Sensitivity and 98% Specificity. The Arbor Vita OncoE6 cervical test was positive for the respective HPV type for all patients with CIN3+ sampled with the Delphi Screener. The Evalyn brush revealed less positive results but histological confirmation of these results is still ongoing. Conclusion(s): These pilot studies show that the sensitivity of HPV genotyping is higher when using the Evalyn Brush for self-sampling compared to the Delphi Screener. Furthermore, Delphi Screener sample is not inferior to the swab sample for the OncoE6 cervical test. We conclude that Delphi Screener and Evalyn brush is feasible for cervical cancer screening by HPV testing in low resource settings and could allow screening women "on the doorstep" in their rural communities.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the impact of tumour hypoxia and cancer stem cell marker expression on outcome of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after primary radiochemotherapy (RCTx). Experimental design: At six Partner Sites of the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 160 patients with HNSCC were included in this retrospective DKTK multicentre study. All patients received primary cisplatin- based RCTx between 2005 and 2011. Their median follow-up was about 29 months. HPV status and CD44 expression were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression analysis was performed for hypoxia-associated genes and the potential CSC marker SLC3A2. Results of the biomarker analyses and clinical parameters were correlated with the clinical outcome. Primary endpoint was loco-regional control (LRC). Result(s): In univariate analysis, HPV status and CSC marker expression were significantly associated with LRC (HPV: HR 0.30, p = 0.02; CD44: HR 2.30, p = 0.04; SLC3A2: HR 2.08, p = 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis including HPV status, tumour localisation, tumour volume and tumour hypoxia or the respective CSC marker showed a significant effect of SLC3A2 (HR 2.03, p = 0.02) or CD44 (HR 2.52, p = 0.04) and a trend for tumour hypoxia (HR 7.86, p = 0.06) on LRC. Interestingly, the tumour volume was an independent variable in all cox models, a high tumour volume was significantly associated with poor LRC. Conclusion(s): We have shown that high CSC marker expression and high tumour volume significantly correlate with poor LRC in patients with locally advanced HNSCC who received primary RCTx. For highly hypoxic tumours, a trend towards poor LRC was seen. After validation of these promising results in our ongoing prospective study of the DKTK-ROG, these biomarkers may help to further stratify patients for individualised treatment escalation or de-escalation strategies.

AB  - The new German S3 guideline 'Prevention of Cervical Cancer' published in 2016 is based on the latest available evidence about cervical cancer screening and treatment of cervical precancer. Large randomized controlled trials indicate that human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening may provide better protection against cervical cancer than cytology alone through improved detection of premalignant disease in the first screening round prior to progression. Therefore, women aged 30 years and older should preferably be screened with HPV testing every 3-5 years (cytology alone every 2 years is an acceptable alternative). Co-testing is not recommended. Screening should start at 25 years using cytology alone every 2 years. The preferred triage test after a positive HPV screening test is cytology. Women positive for HPV 16 and HPV 18 should receive immediate colposcopy. Another alternative triage method is p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology. The mean yearly participation rate in Germany is between 45 and 50%. Offering devices for HPV self-sampling has the potential to increase participation rates in those women who are at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Regarding primary prevention, the 9-valent vaccine may provide protection against up to 85% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 and 90% of cervical cancer, and is available in Europe as a 2-dose schedule from May 2016.Copyright © 2016 S.

AB  - Objectives: Abnormal signs or symptoms recorded on Papanicolaou (Pap) test requisitions may reflect disease not detected with Pap testing. Since 2009, these cases have been reviewed in our laboratory by a second cytotechnologist and a cytopathologist. The objective of this study was to document follow-up findings on these patients. Method(s): A search for Pap test results of "Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, abnormal clinical signs or symptoms" was performed for cases from January 1, 2009, to October 10, 2013. Clinical information and follow- up findings were documented. Result(s): 1,104 cases were identified. Signs and symptoms were abnormal bleeding 897 (81%), polyps 83 (8%), pelvic mass 54 (5%), visible cervical lesions 48 (4%), vaginal lesions 17 (2%) and endometrial masses 6 (0.5%). Six hundred sixty-seven (60%) had follow-up results, including 517 with histopathologic diagnoses. Two-hundred thirty-three (45%) had nonspecific benign diagnoses, 216 (42%) had benign tumor-like conditions, 28 (4%) had insufficient specimens, 16 (3%) had precancerous diagnoses and 23 (4%) had malignancies. Endometrial malignancy was identified in 14 (61%), ovarian in 6 (26%), and miscellaneous in 3 (13%). No cervical cancers were identified. Conclusion(s): We report follow-up findings from patients with abnormal clinical signs or symptoms, negative Pap test results, and follow-up recommendations highlighting reported abnormal signs or symptoms. Abnormal clinical signs and symptoms should routinely be considered in assessment and management of patients with negative cervical screening test results.Copyright © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anyplex II HPV HR (Anyplex_HR; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) is a new multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for screening cervical cancer, and it is designed to detect 14 high-risk human papillomaviruses along with all the genotype information in a single tube. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Anyplex_HR in comparison to that of the Cobas 4800 HPV (Cobas_4800; Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and the Hybrid capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). METHODS: The performance of the Anyplex_HR for high-risk human papillomavirus genotype detection was prospectively evaluated against that of the HC2 and the Cobas_4800 at the National Cancer Center using 400 cervical samples. All discrepant samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with type-specific primers followed by sequencing. RESULTS: The overall agreement and kappa value of the Anyplex_HR with the Cobas_4800 were 98.0% and 0.96, respectively. The level of agreement between the two assays and the corresponding kappa values for human papillomavirus16, human papillomavirus18 and other high-risk human papillomaviruses were 99.5%, 99.8% and 98.8%, and 0.98, 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. The agreement and kappa value of the HC2 with the Cobas_4800 were 95.3% and 0.91. The human papillomavirus positivity of the Anyplex_HR and the Cobas_4800 in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion samples demonstrated 100% concordance. Both the Anyplex_HR and the Cobas_4800 showed excellent results in the precision test. CONCLUSIONS: The Anyplex_HR is comparable with the Cobas_4800 and the HC2 for human papillomavirus DNA testing, and it may prove more useful for follow-up testing and patient management by providing genotyping information additional to human papillomavirus16 and human papillomavirus18.

AB  - Objectives: This study on human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in China's largest independent laboratory accredited by the international Laboratory Accreditation Program of the College of American Pathologists extends previous reports on cervical screening test results from this Chinese facility. Method(s): A retrospective laboratory database search from 2007 to 2014 documented high-risk HPV test results using either Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or multiplex polymerase chain reaction fluorescence testing (MPFT) methods. Result(s): During the study period, HPV testing steadily increased, with 643, 702 HC2 and 27, 641 MPFT HPV tests performed. The mean ages of the tested women were 35.0 years using HC2 and 38.3 years using MPFT. The HC2 HPV-positive rate was 21.7%, significantly higher than 15.7% with MPFT (P < .0001), with bimodal peak incidence in adolescents and women aged 60 to 69 years. Conclusion(s): Use of HPV testing in cervical screening is increasing in China. HC2 HPV-positive rates around 20%in all age groups from more than 500, 000 tested Chinese women are consistent with previous reports from China and significantly higher than published HC2 HPV-positive rates in populations with more widespread cervical screening.MPFT HPV-positive rates were slightly lower in every age group. The high HPV-positive rate likely reflects limited routine cervical screening and high cervical cancer incidence in China.Copyright © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

AB  - Analytically accurate human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping methods are required to assess the impact of HPV vaccination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical performance of Anyplex II HPV28 (Seegene, Korea) and Euroarray HPV (Euroimmun, Germany) genotyping kits, for conducting a future HPV vaccine efficacy monitoring study in Luxembourg. A total number of 150 cervical swabs were collected from women with mean age 31.4 years. Agreements for detecting any HPV between Aptima/Anyplex (88.0%) and Aptima/Euroarray (90.7%) were similar. Agreement of Anyplex/EuroArray with Aptima was higher for Genotypes 16, 18 or 45 than for the other 11 HPVs. The average number of HPV genotypes detected per sample was similar with 2.6 and 2.5, for Anyplex and EuroArray, respectively. In conclusion, Anyplex and Euroarray showed high agreement in general and in particular for detecting genotypes contained in HPV vaccines.

AB  - Mucosal infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for a growing number of malignancies, predominantly represented by cervical cancer and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Because of the prevalence of the virus, persistence of infection, and long latency period, novel and low-cost methods are needed for effective population level screening and monitoring. We review established methods for screening of cervical and oral cancer as well as commercially-available techniques for detection of HPV DNA. We then describe the ongoing development of microfluidic nucleic acid-based biosensors to evaluate circulating host microRNAs that are produced in response to an oncogenic HPV infection. The goal is to develop an ideal screening platform that is low-cost, portable, and easy to use, with appropriate signal stability, sensitivity and specificity. Advances in technologies for sample lysis, pre-treatment and concentration, and multiplexed nucleic acid detection are provided. Continued development of these devices provides opportunities for cancer screening in low resource settings, for point-of-care diagnostics and self-screening, and for monitoring response to vaccination or surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: In 1971 an opportunistic screening program for cancer of the uterine cervix was initiated in Germany. This led to a 75 % reduction in the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. The current European guidelines now recommend the implementation of an organized screening program. Objective(s): Starting in 2018 an organized human papillomavirus (HPV) test-based screening with cytology triage will be established in Germany. This article explains the background to this decision and presents the underlying studies which contributed to the decision. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The existing data show a higher sensitivity of HPV-based screening for cervical cancer compared to a cytology-based program. The HPV test is a simple, reliable and objective procedure. The higher sensitivity and the high negative predictive value of HPV tests allow the interval between examinations to be extended; however, a possible overtreatment of moderate dysplasia of the uterine cervix has to be considered.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the literature, data on the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in men vary significantly and the exact distribution of specific genotypes is still unclear. As infections usually occur without symptoms, men might only attend their hospital clinic when they have a specific concern, being in most cases genital warts (condylomas), which are often caused by low-risk HPV genotypes. The aim of this study was to assess HPV genotype distribution and prevalence among men attending hospital for HPV-associated conditions and to evaluate infection-associated factors. METHODS: Samples from men with clinical manifestations of HPV-related infections seen during 2007-2012 at the Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Control Department at Basurto University Hospital were genotyped using Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test kit (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Germany). Data on probable risk factors were collected and investigated for possible association. RESULTS: Of 184 anogenital samples, 138 (75 %) were tested as positive for HPV; 57 (41.3 %) single HPV infections and 81 (58.7 %) multiple infections. Only 45.6 % of HPV-positive samples presented low-risk genotypes 6 or 11, whereas 71/138 (51.4 %) had at least one oncogenic (high-risk) genotype. Oncogenic genotypes and multiple HPV infections were both associated with a higher number of lifetime sexual partners and their incidence appeared to increase with patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is accepted that HPV 6 and 11 genotypes are main causes of condylomas, our findings show a high incidence of multiple infections and high-risk genotypes in men with benign HPV manifestations. The fact that the condyloma is a skin lesion facilitates the entry of virus into cells and thus cancer progression; therefore, monitoring for HPV is important, especially in those patients with high-risk genotypes (regardless of whether they cause condyloma).

AB  - Cervical specimens collected in liquid-based cytology (LBC) media are the most common sample type used for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Since preanalytic steps such as vortexing and decapping vials, liquid transfer to a sample input tube with matching unique identifier, and recapping the original vials are required for processing LBC samples prior to running the Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV assay (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany), a full manual execution can be complicated, especially in high-throughput diagnostic contexts. Here, a custom-configured worktable setup for the Tecan Freedom EVO (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) designed to automate and control preanalytic steps for ThinPrep (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) samples was used to evaluate the impact of automated versus manual preanalytics. Archival results for manual processing of 226 samples were compared with those obtained with the Tecan protocol, observing a very good overall concordance for final assay interpretation (95.6%). High overall agreement (100%) resulted also from retesting 99 samples by both the preanalytical protocols. High reproducibility was observed analyzing 23 randomly selected samples by automated preprocessing in triplicate. Hence, the new configuration of the Tecan platform translates the manual steps required to process ThinPrep specimens into automated operations, controls sample identification, and allows for saving hands-on time, while maintaining assay reproducibility and ensuring reliability of results, making it suitable for screening settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We modelled human papilloma virus (HPV) primary screening scenarios compared with Pap cytology to evaluate clinical effectiveness and projected annual costs in Germany. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov cohort model was built to compare the budget impact of annual Pap cytology with different 5-yearly HPV screening scenarios: (1) a positive HPV test followed by Pap cytology; (2) a positive HPV test followed by p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology; (3) a positive HPV test followed by colposcopy if HPV-16/18-positive or p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology if positive for other subtypes; (4) co-testing with HPV and Pap. Screening scenarios were based on a 10-year horizon. RESULTS: All HPV screening scenarios in the model were associated with fewer deaths from missed diagnosis of cervical cancer compared with Pap screening; 10-year totals n=172-344 (1.5-3 per 100,000) versus n=477 (4.1 per 100,000), respectively. Total annual costs were lower with HPV screening than Pap cytology. The projected average annual cost for HPV screening ranged from euro117 million to euro136 million compared with euro177 million for Pap screening, representing annual savings of euro41-60 million. The greatest clinical impact was achieved with primary HPV screening (with genotyping) followed by colposcopy for HPV 16/18-positive women or p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology for women positive for other HPV subtypes. CONCLUSION: Screening strategies including primary HPV testing for high-risk subtypes (HPV-16/18) in conjunction with p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology can improve the detection of cervical cancer at a lower total annual cost than conventional Pap cytology screening.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate possible association between high-risk Human papillomavirus (HR HPV) - induced cervical infection, HR HPV-related cervical dysplasia, HR HPV genotypes with two Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 gene polymorphisms and other risk factors. Method(s): During a three-year period, 100 women positive for cervical HR HPV infection (97 with cervical dysplasia and 3 positive women without dysplasia) were genotyped using the Linear Array HPV Genotyping assay (Roche Diag-nostics). Furthermore, two polymorphisms of TLR9 (-1486T/C, rs187084 and 2848C/T rs352140) were determined using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; 50 HR HPV negative women of similar ethnicity were included as controls. Result(s): This study showed that infections with HPV 16 in women with cervical dysplasia were more frequently found compared with HPV 18 infections (p=0.0539). Comparison between HR HPV positive and negative women showed significant association between age >35 years (p=0.0058), being unmarried women (p=0.0001), nocondom usage (p=0.0304) and active tobacco smoking (p=0.0376) with HR HPV cervical infection. No significant associations between two TLR9 gene polymorphisms, HR HPV infection and cervical dysplasia were found. Conclusion(s): Our results indicated that: i) women with cervical dysplasia showed significant higher rate of HR HPV 16 infection compared to HR HPV 18, ii) HR HPV - infection was strongly correlated with social risk factors and iii) TLR9 gene polymorphisms (rs187084; rs352140) did not correlate with HR HPV infection and cervical dysplasia. Further genome-wide association studies could open new frontier in understanding the relationship between polymorphisms at TLR9 and immunological mechanisms in HPV-induced carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2017, University Hospital of Infectious Diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The risk factors for vulvar dysplasia and infections are not fully known. In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between pubic hair shaving and the occurrence of vulvar inflammation, dysplasia, and cancer. METHODS: This study was performed between January 2013 and December 2016 in which a standardized questionnaire concerning genital hair shaving was administered to vulvar dysplasia and cancer patients and healthy participants. The presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and the occurrence of genital inflammation were documented. RESULTS: We recruited 49 patients with vulvar dysplasia or cancer and 234 healthy women as a control group. Smoking, HPV infection, genital inflammation, and complete pubic hair removal were significantly more common in the vulvar dysplasia/cancer group. Pubic hair shaving per se presented a clear association with vulvar dysplasia/cancer. Shaving the labia majora in particular showed also an association. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that partial or complete pubic hair shaving using a razor is correlated with and could be a potential risk factor for the development of genital inflammation, vulvar dysplasia, and malignancies. These results need to be confirmed in larger studies. HPV status and genital inflammation should be documented by medical personnel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The suitability and stability of cervical cells in Novaprep media (NHQ) for certain HPV assays is unknown. METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of an automated HPV assay (Abbott RealTime HR HPV) for cervical cells prepared in NHQ and NHQ with a pre-treatment to mimic a worst case clinical use, compared to the assay manufacturers media; repeatability and reproducibility of HPV results and the stability of detectable HPV in NHQ over time compared to CE marked liquid based cytology preservatives. Cell lines were used to simulate patient samples. RESULTS: Cells stored in NHQ produced accurate, repeatable and reproducible results. Stability in NHQ was comparable to the best performing LBC, with at least 7 months' stability at 18-25 degrees C, 2-8 degrees C, -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C; and at least 3 months' stability at 40 degrees C. Similar results were obtained for pre-treated NHQ except only 3.5 months' stability at 18-25 degrees C. Cell line samples in all media and concentrations tested were detected appropriately by the assay. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this first stage validation analytical study, cervical cells stored in NHQ are suitable for the Realtime HPV assay. There should be no reservations for inclusion of NHQ in any further validation and clinical performance evaluation of this assay.

AB  - HPV-based screening provides greater protection against cervical cancer (CC) than cytology-based strategies. Currently, several molecular diagnostic assays for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) are available. In this study, we analyzed 5 different HPV testing and genotyping techniques (Hybrid Capture 2 [HC2; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany], AnyplexTMII HPV28 [Anyplex; Seegene, Seoul, Korea], Linear Array [Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA], GP5+/6+ PCR-EIA-RH [Labo Bio-medical Products, Rijswijk, The Netherlands] and CLART2 [Genomica, Madrid, Spain]) in 295 women referred to the hospital Colposcopy Clinic from 2007 to 2008 due to positive HPV test results or an abnormal Pap test. DNA extraction for HPV genotyping was performed in cervical sample specimens after Pap test and HPV detection by HC2. The inclusion criteria were: (1) adequate cervical sampling with sufficient material for the Pap test and HPV detection and genotyping, and (2) colposcopically-directed biopsy and/or endocervical curettage. HC2 showed the highest sensitivity for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and CC (HSIL+) detection (96.1%), but all the HPV genotyping tests showed a higher specificity. (Anyplex 86.8%; Linear Array 86.0%; GP5+/6+ 78.8%; CLART2 76.5%). The agreement between HC2 results and the other techniques was similar: 82.4%, kappa=0.650 for Anyplex; 83.4%, kappa=0.670 for Linear Array, 79.93%, kappa=0.609 for GP5+/6+ and 82.4%, kappa=0.654 for CLART2. HPV 16 and/or 18 infection was a risk factor for underlying HSIL+ in the univariate analysis. Anyplex showed the highest risk of underlying HSIL+ after positive HPV 16 and/or 18 tests (OR 31.1; 95% CI 12.1-80.0).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the extent of the cross-reactivity of hybrid capture 2 (HC2) assay and evaluate the potential effect of cross-reactivity on the long-term risk for cervical cancer and precancers. METHODS: Based on the Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study-I (SPOCCS-I) cohort from 2005 to 2014 in Shanxi, China, SPF(1)(0)-line probe assay (LiPA) was performed in all 598 HC2 positive and 300 random-selected HC2 negative cervical specimens. Ten-year cumulative incidence rate (CIR) of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) of these two tests was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Possible human papillomavirus (HPV) types to be cross-reacted by HC2 were also analyzed. RESULTS: The overall agreement between HC2 and SPF(1)(0)-LiPA for detecting carcinogenic HPV was 73.27%. The highest 10-year cumulative risk of CIN2+ was observed in both HC2 positive and LiPA-carcinogenic HPV positive women (25.70%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=23.55%-27.91%), followed by HC2 positive but LiPA-non-carcinogenic HPV positive women (9.97%; 95% CI=8.57%-11.50%), HC2 negative but LiPA-carcinogenic HPV positive (2.56%; 95% CI=2.44%-2.70%) and HC2 positive but LiPA-HPV negative (1.85%; 95% CI=1.78%-1.92%) women. The proportion of cross-reactivity of HC2 with untargeted carcinogenic types was 8.9%, most of which were attributable to HPV26, 73, 82, 69, 71, 53, 11, 43, and 54. CONCLUSION: The noticeable high risk of CIN2+ in women infected with cross-reacted non-carcinogenic HPV and low risk in those with miss-to-detective carcinogenic HPV supported an overall good clinical performance of HC2 for a general cervical cancer screening.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced lesions rarely develop in the urethral meatus (UM); however, their eradication can be problematic. Method(s): A total of 22 patients with anogenital warts (AGWs) in the UM region and 22 patients with AGWs located at other anatomical sites were included in this cross-sectional study. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in biopsy samples was determined using the HPV Easy typing kit (GenID GmbH, Germany). Result(s): Although the patients in the AGW group with involvement of the UM had a higher incidence of reported multiple sexual partners (63.6% vs. 40.9%), larger meatus size (81.8% vs. 36.4%), and more frequent anal (36.4% vs. 18.2%) or unprotected sexual contact (68.2% vs. 36.4%) than those in the AGW group without UM involvement, only the duration of lesions (p = 0.04) and meatus size (p = 0.004) were significantly different in both groups. Low-risk HPV types were found in 75.0% and 69.2% of patients in the AGW groups with and without UM involvement, respectively. Conclusion(s): We found that a larger UM size was more prone to the development of meatus AGWs; however, being married, delaying sexual debut, and avoidance of multiple sexual partners seemed to be associated with a decreased risk of development of AGWs, especially within the UM region.Copyright © 2017, Slovenian Medical Society.

AB  - Aim: In this study, the novel VisionArray HPV assay was compared with the LCD CHIP array for the detection of HPVs in tonsillar carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): A Panel of tonsillar tumors and control samples containing know HPV isolates were tested with the VisonArry HPV Assay (Zytovision, Bremerhaven, Germany) and the Chipron MycoDirect LCD Assay (Chipron, Berlin, Germany). Result(s): While both assays enabled the discrimination between low-risk, intermediate and high-risk types, the LCD CHIP assay had a better laboratory performance and was more comfortable in its usage. However, both arrays delivered comparable results. Conclusion(s): Both assays are appropriate tools for the detection of clinically relevant HPV strains in tonsillar tumors. However, if the LCD CHIP array is established, the more complex workflow required for the VisionArray HPV assay could restrain diagnostic labs from a change to this novel assay despite its good quality.Copyright © 2017 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 2 and 3 is the recommended strategy for preventing invasive carcinoma in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our objective was to assess the efficacy of thermoablation in the treatment of CIN2 and CIN3 in a screen-and-treat approach. Method(s): Women aged 30-49 years in Dschang, Cameroon, were invited to undergo vaginal sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV), samples being assessed by an Xpert HPV Assay. HPV-positive women underwent visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI), cervical biopsy, and endocervical curettage. Women positive for HPV-16/18/45 or other HPV types with abnormal VIA/VILI were treated by thermoablation on the same day. The primary outcome was persistence of high-grade disease on cytologic examination at 12 months. Result(s): Of a total of 1,012 recruited women, 188 were HPV-positive, 121 patients required thermoablation, and 99 had a CIN of grade 2, making the overtreatment rate 9.9%. The cure rate for CIN2 and CIN3 at 12 months was 70.6%. Failure (higher risk of persistent disease) was associated with the presence of occult endocervical lesions at baseline diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] =128.97 [95% confidence interval [CI], 8.80-1,890.95]; p,0.0001). First sexual intercourse before the age of 15 was also a risk factor (aOR =0.003 [95% CI, 0.001-0.61]; p=0.023). Conclusion(s): In LMICs, use of thermoablation in a screen-and-treat approach is a valuable treatment option for CIN2 and CIN3. Studies comparing thermoablation with cryotherapy are needed to determine the most appropriate treatment for cervical precancer in such countries.Copyright © 2017 Tran et al.

AB  - This study evaluates the suitability of Xpert HPV (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) test for cervical and tonsillar formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples as compared to the tests currently used in diagnostics. Cervical biopsies and liquid cytology (LC) samples were collected from 48 women attending colposcopy. Biopsies were processed for histology and tested for hrHPV using Xpert HPV. LC samples were tested using Xpert and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) tests. Also 29 archived tonsillar carcinoma samples were tested using Xpert, and the results were compared with histology and immunohistochemical p16INK4a (p16) staining. Among valid cervical LC samples 46.8% were hrHPV positive using Xpert test and 55.3% with HC2. The sensitivity of Xpert was 84.6% as compared to HC2, and overall test concordance was 91.5%. Test concordance between valid Xpert results from biopsies and LC samples was 84.6%. Among valid tonsillar samples 70.4% were hrHPV positive, and concordance of 96.3% was found between Xpert and p16 staining. To conclude, Xpert HPV test cartridge provides a convenient platform to test individual samples, including FFPE samples. Further studies are needed to establish whether test sensitivity is sufficient to reliably differentiate between hrHPV positive and hrHPV negative head and neck carcinomas.

AB  - The objective of the presented cross-sectional-evaluation-screening study is the clinical evaluation of high-risk(hr)HPVE7-protein detection as a triage method to colposcopy for hrHPV-positive women, using a newly developed sandwich-ELISA-assay. Between 2013-2015, 2424 women, 30-60 years old, were recruited at the Hippokratio Hospital, Thessaloniki/Greece and the Im Mare Klinikum, Kiel/Germany, and provided a cervical sample used for Liquid Based Cytology, HPV DNA genotyping, and E7 detection using five different E7-assays: "recomWell HPV16/18/45KJhigh", "recomWell HPV16/18/45KJlow", "recomWell HPV39/51/56/59", "recomWell HPV16/31/33/35/52/58" and "recomWell HPVHRscreen" (for 16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59 E7), corresponding to different combinations of hrHPVE7-proteins. Among 1473 women with eligible samples, those positive for cytology (ASCUS+ 7.2%), and/or hrHPV DNA (19.1%) were referred for colposcopy. Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) was detected in 27 women (1.8%). For HPV16/18-positive women with no triage, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and the number of colposcopies needed to detect one case of CIN2+ were 100.0%, 11.11% and 9.0 respectively. The respective values for E7-testing as a triage method to colposcopy ranged from 75.0-100.0%, 16.86-26.08% and 3.83-5.93. Sensitivity and PPV for cytology as triage for hrHPV(non16/18)-positive women were 45.45% and 27.77%; for E7 test the respective values ranged from 72.72-100.0% and 16.32-25.0%. Triage of HPV 16/18-positive women to colposcopy with the E7 test presents better performance than no triage, decreasing the number of colposcopies needed to detect one CIN2+. In addition, triage of hrHPV(non16/18)-positive women with E7 test presents better sensitivity and slightly worse PPV than cytology, a fact that advocates for a full molecular screening approach.

AB  - Substantial evidence exists to support the introduction of molecular testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) as the primary technology in cervical cancer screening. While HPV testing is much more sensitive than cytology for detection of high-grade precancerous lesions, it is less specific. To improve efficiency, it is therefore recommended that a specific test (like cytology) be used in triaging HPV positive women to colposcopy. A number of studies have been conducted that support the use of cytology alone or in conjunction with HPV genotyping for triage. The decision to incorporate genotyping also depends on the commercial HPV test that is selected since not all tests provide results for certain individual high-risk types. Regardless of whether policy officials decide to adopt a triage approach that incorporates genotyping, the use of liquid based cytology (LBC) may also improve screening performance by reducing diagnostic delays. With LBC, the same cell suspension from a single collection may be used for HPV testing and a smear can be immediately prepared if HPV status is positive. This was a critical lesson from a community based demonstration project in Montreal (VASCAR study), where conventional cytology exists and specimen co-collection was not permitted for ethical reasons, requiring HPV positive women to return for an additional screening visit prior to colposcopy.Copyright © 2016

AB  - Background: The randomized, phase 3 EXTREME study established cetuximab + platinum + 5-flurouracil (5-FU) followed by cetuximab maintenance until progressive disease (PD) as the first regimen to yield survival benefits in the 1L management of patients with R/M SCCHN. In EXTREME, the addition of cetuximab increased the overall response rate from 20% to 36%, and extended progression-free survival from 3.3 to 5.6 months and overall survival from 7.4 to 10.1 months. ENCORE is a multinational, non-interventional, prospective, open-label study, seeking to determine how treatment decisions are made, planned and executed by oncologists treating patients with 1L therapy for R/M SCCHN in the real world. Method(s): ENCORE prospectively enrolled 219 patients with R/M SCCHN from Algeria, France, Italy, Portugal and Russia. The recommended treatment for these patients is cetuximab + PBT for up to 6 cycles followed by cetuximab maintenance until PD. Patient characteristics, drugs and schedule were recorded; as the study is still ongoing, safety and efficacy will not be reported here. Result(s): ENCORE patients and the EXTREME patients who received cetuximab + platinum + 5-FU had similar performance status (PS: 13.7 and 12% with PS >= 2, respectively), but dissimilar median age (64 and 56 years, respectively). In ENCORE, 94.1% of patients had a planned treatment of cetuximab + PBT with cetuximab maintenance until PD. The remaining 13 (5.9%) had a fixed treatment duration of 4 to 24 weeks. 37.9% of treatment plans used cisplatin, 61.6% included carboplatin and 3.2% used a taxane. Also, only 53.4% of plans included 5-FU. When developing the treatment plan, 72.1% of all patients were discussed within the context of a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Most plans had the goal of palliative care, and 80% were formulated without a p16 or human papillomavirus status test. Updated data will be presented at congress. Conclusion(s): The ENCORE study shows that a real-world R/M SCCHN patient population treated with the EXTREME regimen has diverse characteristics and is treated per current recommendations (e.g. in an MDT setting, with cetuximab until PD).

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is the third most common malignancy in women worldwide. Almost all cervical cancers are associated with human papilloma viruses (HPV) but the majority of women with HPV do not develop cervical cancer. This study is aimed to find the microRNAs (miRNAs) as an explanatory variable and early tumor marker in cervical carcinogenesis. Method(s): We analyzed the miRNAs expression profiles in 12 cervical tissues by NanoString nCounter system miRNA Assay (813 miRNAs panel) using the digital multiplexed counting method. Significant miRNAs were selected based on arbitrary fold change >= 2 and p-value <= 0.01 using R software (v3.1.1). To validate selected significant miRNAs, thirty-four cervical tissues performed real-time RT-PCR using the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the StepOnePlusTM Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) using 2X QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). The data were analyzed using the StepOne software v2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels of each miRNAs were calculated using the 2-deltadeltaCt method after normalization with endogenous control small RNA, U6. Result(s): Six genes (miR-9-5p, -136-5p, -148a-3p, -190a-5p, -199b-5p, -382-5p) were expressed significantly higher and two genes (miR-597-5p, -655-3p) were expressed lower in HPV16-positive cervical cancer group than the HPV16-positive normal group and pooled normal group (HPV-negative and HPV16-positive) in clinical tissues experiments. Conclusion(s): Eight dysregulated miRNAs in cervical cancer will be possible early diagnostic biomarkers for women with HPV16 to predict cancer development. Especially, the miR-9-5p and miR-199b-5p might be expected most significant among them considering with previous reports consistent with our results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The cost-effectiveness of Human papillomavirus (HPV)-based primary cervical screening in the Irish healthcare setting is assessed using a decision-analysis approach to inform a decision around changes to the national screening program. Current practices comprises primary screening with liquid-based cytology (LBC) followed by HPV triage, at 3-yearly intervals for ages 25 to 45 years and 5-yearly until age 60 years. METHOD(S): This study assessed changing the primary screening test from LBC to HPV testing, in both an unvaccinated and a vaccinated (against HPV 16/18) cohort. It considered extending the screening interval (to 5-yearly for all), the upper age limit (from 60 to 65 years) and different test sequences (four possible tests were included: HPV, LBC, partial genotyping for HPV16 or HPV 18 and the molecular biomarker p16INK4a/Ki67). A Markov-model for HPV-infection and cervical cancer was developed based on a German cervical screening model (1). The perspective of the healthcare system was adopted and a 5 percent discount rate used. RESULT(S): Strategies using HPV as the primary screening test are more effective than LBC-based strategies. The optimal strategy, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR45,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), for the unvaccinated cohort was HPV-based primary screening with a LBC triage test, at five-yearly intervals from age 25 to 60 years. This strategy is cost saving compared with current practice and cost effective when compared to no screening, with an Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR18,164 per QALY. The optimal strategy for the vaccinated cohort was also HPV primary screening with a LBC triage test, at five-yearly intervals from age 25 to 60 years. While more effective and cost saving compared with current practice, it would not be considered cost effective compared with no screening (ICER of EUR58,745/QALY). CONCLUSION(S): Based on our analyses, HPV-based cervical screening is more effective and cost saving compared with LBC-based screening for both vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts in an Irish setting.

AB  - Aims HPV is a known factor for some vulvar cancers. The objective was to evaluate the distribution of hrHPV types in vulvar cancer samples obtained from Kazakhstani women. Method A total of 64 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples obtained from the same number of Kazakhstani women with histologically confirmed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were included in the study. DNA was extracted using a DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following our in-house protocol. Detection of hrHPV types was performed using a RealTime High Risk HPV Test (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany), which enables concurrent separate genotyping of HPV16 and HPV18 and pooled detection of 12 other hrHPV types: HPV31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. Results Out of 64 samples tested, 2 (3.1%) were excluded from the analysis due to invalid results for amplification of beta-globin. In total, 20/62 (32.3%) samples tested positive for the presence of hrHPV types. HPV16, HPV18, and other hrHPV types were present in 17/20 (85.0%), 1/20 (5.0%), and 2/20 (10.0%) samples, respectively. Only single infections were detected. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the distribution of hrHPV types among Kazakhstani women with vulvar cancer. Approximately 32% of samples tested positive for the presence of hrHPV types, of which HPV16 (85.0%) was the most common hrHPV type detected, suggesting HPV vaccine could have a substantial impact on the incidence rate of vulvar cancer in Kazakhstan. However, further studies are needed to confirm our observations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare E6/E7 mRNA and HPV DNA assays for evaluating women with atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). METHODS: The present prospective study enrolled patients with ASCUS undergoing HPV testing at Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China, between September 1, 2013, and January 31, 2016. Patients with positive HPV DNA test results underwent screening by E6/E7 mRNA assay, and the accuracy of HPV DNA and E6/E7 mRNA testing were compared, with histology used for definitive diagnoses. RESULTS: In total, 591 patients with ASCUS underwent HPV DNA screening, with 455 and 136 having positive and negative results, respectively; 252 patients with positive results and 66 with negative results underwent biopsy and histology testing and were included in the study. The sensitivity of the E6/E7 mRNA assay was similar to that of HPV DNA testing (88.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 77.6-94.4 vs 90.7%, 95%CI 81.2-95.9; P=0.636) for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+, and the specificity was higher (36.4%, 95%CI 29.6-43.9 vs 24.3%, 95%CI 19.1-30.3; P=0.006). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was greater for E6/E7 mRNA testing compared with HPV DNA testing (0.658 vs 0.588). CONCLUSION: The higher specificity of the E6/E7 mRNA assay means it could be a promising technique in the management of women with ASCUS.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are DNA viruses that can infect epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. Currently, over 150 different HPV types are known, which are classified into high-risk and low-risk types depending on the carcinogenicity. About 40 of these HPV types affect the genital tract. HPV infection can result in various benign and malignant diseases in women and men. Some HPV types (HPV 1, 2, 3, 4, 10) cause harmless skin warts. The so-called low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 cause genital warts, while the high-risk types, such as HPV 16 and 18, are causally responsible for the development of cervical cancer. In addition, high-risk HPV types are involved in the development of other cancers, such as anal, vaginal, and vulvar cancer, but also tumors in the head and neck region. HPVs are the most frequently sexually transmitted infections worldwide. However, other modes of transmission are also possible, such as from the mother to her child during birth. Worldwide and in Europe, the HPV prevalence in women is estimated to be about 12%, and the most frequently detected HPV type is HPV 16. However, the HPV prevalence is significantly higher for young women under the age of 25 and is estimated to be 20 to over 40%. The high-risk HPV prevalence in women over 30 years in Germany is estimated to be 6.4%. For women under 30 years of age, HPV prevalence in Germany is 22.3%. The HPV prevalence, however, strongly depends on the sample being studied as well as the HPV test used. In Germany, women aged 20 and over are eligible to receive a cytological smear for early cancer detection, and girls between the ages of 9 and 14 can receive a free prophylactic HPV vaccination. Currently there is no organized cervical cancer screening program in Germany.Copyright © 2017, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Aims Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a causative agent for approximately 5% of all new cancer cases in humans. The virus is detected in cervical, anal, vaginal, penile, vulvar and head and neck cancers and has prognostic implications. Thus, test systems are required to detect high-risk but also low-risk HPV subtypes with high specificity and sensitivity in a time-effective and cost-effective manner. In the present study we developed a new mass spectrometry (MS)-based test system for the detection of HPV infections in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Methods A high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight MS-based assay was applied to genotype 19 HPV types in FFPE tissue specimens (n=46). The results from the MS assay were compared with the results obtained from two hybridisation-based test systems: the HPV 3.5 LCD-array kit and the EuroArrayHPV system. Results In 36 out of 46 (78%) tissue samples, a HPV infection could be detected by the MS-based HPV assay. In 16 samples (44%) only one and in 20 samples (56%) two to six HPV subtypes were identified. The overall agreement of all three assays was almost perfect (Cohen's k value: 0.83). Conclusions The MS-based assay is highly sensitive, reliable as well as cost-effective and represents a suitable technology for the detection of HPV infections in FFPE tissue material.Copyright © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - Anal squamous cell cancer has a precancerous stage of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Some centers still use the terminology of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) where HSIL covers AIN2 and AIN3. Techniques that may be used for screening to prevent anal cancer aim to detect HSIL with high sensitivity and specificity and relatively low cost. Cytology and human papillomavirus detection are currently available; however, both have insufficient sensitivity and specificity to be reliable screening techniques, especially in the highest-risk groups for anal cancer. Biomarker tests are under consideration. High resolution anoscopy (HRA) is the gold standard for detecting anal precancer lesions; however, it is expensive and labor-intensive. For these reasons, there is a lack of national screening strategies for anal cancer. Guidelines quickly become out of date in this rapidly changing field: the German-Austrian 2015 guidelines are the most current.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aims Mortality for cervical cancer varies between the different regions of the world, with high rates in low-income countries where screening programmes are not present and organised. However, increasing screening coverage is still a priority in all countries: one way to do that is to base screening on self-sampled screening. The success of a self-sampling screening strategy depends on capacity to recruit unscreened women, on the performance and acceptability of the device and on the clinical performance of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) test. Methods This study based on 786 enrolled women investigates the best cut-off value of Hybrid Capture 2 HPV test (HC2) for self-sampled specimens in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results In this population, we found that the sensitivity and the specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more detection of HC2 performed on self-sampled specimens were 82.5% and 82.8%, respectively considering the relative light units (RLU) cut-off value of 1. Increasing the cut-off value the sensitivity decreases and the specificity raises and the best area under the curve for the RLU cut-off value is 1. Conclusions Our results confirm that the cut-off value of 1 suggested by Qiagen for PreservCyt specimen is the best cut-off value also for self-sampled specimens.Copyright © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - To more fully characterize the clinical and pathologic spectrum of a recently described tumor entity of the sinonasal tract characterized by loss of nuclear expression of SMARCB1 (INI1), we analyzed 39 SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas collected from multiple medical centers. The tumors affected 23 males and 16 females with an age range of 19 to 89 years (median, 52). All patients presented with locally advanced disease (T3, n=5; T4, n=27) involving the sinuses (mainly ethmoid) with variable involvement of the nasal cavity. Thirty patients received surgery and/or radiochemotherapy with curative intent. At last follow-up, 56% of patients died of disease 0 to 102 months after diagnosis (median, 15), 2 were alive with disease, and 1 died of an unrelated cause. Only 9 patients (30%) were alive without disease at last follow-up (range, 11 to 115 mo; median, 26). The original diagnosis of retrospectively identified cases was most often sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (n=14) and nonkeratinizing/basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (n=5). Histologically, most tumors displayed either a predominantly basaloid (61%) or plasmacytoid/rhabdoid morphology (36%). The plasmacytoid/rhabdoid form consisted of sheets of tumor cells with abundant, eccentrically placed eosinophilic cytoplasm, whereas similar cells were typically rare and singly distributed in the basaloid variant. Glandular differentiation was seen in a few tumors. None of the cases showed squamous differentiation or surface dysplasia. By immunohistochemistry, the tumors were positive for pancytokeratin (97%), CK5 (64%), p63 (55%), and CK7 (48%); and they were negative for NUT (0%). Epstein-Barr virus and high-risk human papillomavirus was not detected by in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemical loss of SMARCB1 (INI1) expression was confirmed for all 39 tumors. Investigation of other proteins in the SWI/SNF complex revealed co-loss of SMARCA2 in 4 cases, but none were SMARCA4 deficient or ARID1A deficient. Of 27 tumors with SMARCB1 fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, 14 showed homozygous (biallelic) deletions and 7 showed heterozygous (monoallelic) deletions. SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma represents an emerging poorly differentiated/undifferentiated sinonasal carcinoma that (1) cannot be better classified as another specific tumor type, (2) has consistent histopathologic findings (albeit with some variability) with varying proportions of plasmacytoid/rhabdoid cells, and (3) demonstrates an aggressive clinical course. This entity should be considered in any difficult-to-classify sinonasal carcinoma, as correct diagnosis will be mandatory for optimizing therapy and for further delineation of this likely underdiagnosed disease.

AB  - Introduction: Cervical cancer (CC) is first cancer in terms of frequency and mortality among women in Senegal. This is a public health problem hence the urgency of preventive measures including vaccination. The choice of the vaccine cannot be made on strictly financial factors, nor on the results of the others studies, but should take into account the prevalence and distribution of HPV in the CC in Senegal. We conducted this study with the aim of determining the distribution of the genotype of the different types of HPV found in the CC in Senegal and propose a vaccine for Senegal. Method(s): It was a retrospective and descriptive study carried out in cooperation with the molecular and radiobiology institute of Lyon. Sixty paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were chosen by a simple random method on 1015 blocks of CC diagnosed in pathology laboratories of public hospitals of Senegal. In Lyon, the total DNA of the tumor genome was extracted and amplified according to the multiplex PCR technique using primers MY09-MY11, GP5 + and GP6 +. beta-globin was used as an internal control. Result(s): Of the 60 paraffin blocks examined, DNA extraction was unsatisfactory in 4 cases. HPV-HR infection was present in all other tumors. It was a monoinfection in 33 cases (59%) and a multi-infection in 23 cases (41%). In total, of the 56 validated cases, 89 HPV-HR were identified by the PCR-multiplex technique. HPV 16 and 18 accounted for about 70% of all HPV implicated in the CC in Senegal. The other HPV types found are HPV 45 (9), HPV 35 (5), HPV 58 (5), HPV 39 (3), HPV 66 (2), and one case of HPV 31, 33, 51, 59, 68. In 51 patients (91.1%), HPV 16 or 18 was at least one of the viruses involved. Conclusion(s): The involvement of HPV in CC was first reported by German virologist Harold Zur Hausen in 1980. Several studies have subsequently corroborated this association by finding a stronger binding of HPV to CC than that of tobacco to lung cancer. In 1996, the WHO recognized HPV-HR as the leading cause of CC. There is a variable distribution of HPV in the literature according to geographical and ethnic criteria. In Senegal, as almost everywhere else, HPV 16 and to a lesser degree HPV 18 represent the two major viruses involved in carcinogenesis of the cervix. Of twelve identified viral genotypes, HPV 16 and HPV 18 account for nearly 70% of viral infections and are involved in more than 90% of CC cases. At present, there are three types of vaccines: Cervarix (HPV 16, 18), Gardasil (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) and Gardasil 9 (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58). The authors recommend the use of Cervarix in the cancer plan of Senegal. They also advise a better sexual education to control the infection and especially the multi-infection found in 40% in the CC in Senegal. Finally, they emphasize that vaccination is not exclusive of screening but rather should accompany it.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) cause common warts, laryngeal papilloma, and genital condylomata and might lead to development of cervical cancer. Lactoferrin (LF) is a member of the transferrin family, which has antiviral activity against HPV-16. LF is an important player in the defense against pathogenic microorganisms and has also been shown to have activity against several viruses including herpesvirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and poliovirus. Bovine LF (BLF) has been reported to be a more potent inhibitor of HPV entry in comparison to human LF. The goal of the present study is to formulate, evaluate and optimize transfersomal vesicles as a non-invasive transdermal delivery system which assumed to be a suitable for treatment of genital warts. Transfersomes have been prepared by two methods including reverse phase evaporation and thin film hydration with different ratios of cholesterol: lecithin: DOTAP in the presence of SDS or Tween 80. The transferosomes were then evaluated regarding size, polydispersity, and LF loading. In-vitro release studies in pH 5.3 and 7.4, stability evaluation in 4 degreeC and 25 degreeC, and TEM imaging hve been performed on optimized transferosomal lactoferrin. The optimized transferosomes were found to have 100 nm sizes with good polydispersity index and encapsulation efficiency of 91% for lactoferrin as well as sustained release of lactoferrin during 24 h. Transferosomal lactoferrin efficacy was evaluated by MTT assay. It was seen that the viral inhibitory concentration (IC50) of transfersomal lactoferrin has been significantly improved to nearly one tenth in comparison to free lactoferrin.Copyright © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

AB  - Background. To overcome obstacles within the Slovenian organised cervical cancer screening programme, a randomised pilot study of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling among non-attenders was performed, aiming to assess three different screening approaches. Participants and methods. Non-attenders aged 30-64 years from two Slovenian regions were randomised to two HPV self-sampling groups -the opt-in (I1, n = 14.400) and the opt-out (I2, n = 9.556), with a control group (P, n = 2.600). Self-collected samples were analysed using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. HPV-positive women were invited to a colposcopy. The overall and type-specific intention-to-screen response rates and histological outcomes with a positive predictive value (PPV) according to the women's age, the screening approach, the level of protection resulting from previous screening history, and the region of residence were assessed. Results. Of the 26.556 women enrolled, 8.972 (33.8%) responded with self-sample for HPV testing and/or traditional cytology within one year of enrolment. Response rates were 37.7%, 34.0% and 18.4% (p < 0.050) for opt-out, opt-in and control groups. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2+ was diagnosed in 3.9/1.000, 3.4/1.000, and 3.1/1.000 women (p > 0.050), respectively. PPV of the HPV self-sampling was 12.0% and 9.6% for CIN2+ and CIN3+. The highest PPV was obtained in non-attenders in screening programme for more than 10-years and concordant results of HPV testing with 40.8% for CIN2+ and 38.8% for CIN3+. Conclusions. The results of our study show that a high response to HPV self-sampling can be achieved also in an opt-in approach, if women are encouraged to choose between self-sampling at home and screening with gynaecologist. In addition, clinically important risk difference for a high-grade cervical lesion exists in the case of a positive result of HPV testing on self-collected samples, depending on the length of the interval since last screening. Stratified management of these women should be strongly considered. Women who were not screened with cytology for at least 10 years should be referred to immediate colposcopy for histology verification instead to delayed re-testing.Copyright © 2018 Association of Radiology and Oncology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of anal carcinoma has risen in recent decades. Exfoliative cytology screening of selected high risk patients is performed in many centers. Unsatisfactory cytology results are frustrating to patients, clinicians, and laboratorians. The aim of this study is to ascertain outcomes of patients with non-diagnostic anal cytology. METHODS: A retrospective review of anal cytology testing performed at the Cleveland Clinic between 01/01/2001 and 12/31/2015 was performed. All cases were received as liquid-based samples and processed as ThinPreps (Hologic, Marlborough, MA). Co-testing for HR-HPV DNA was performed using Hybrid Capture 2(R) (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) in the majority of patients. RESULTS: Of 1,276 ThinPrep anal cytology samples, 130 (10%) were deemed unsatisfactory. 77% of patients were HIV positive. 85% were males. Of the unsatisfactory cases, 116 (89%) were co-tested for HR-HPV DNA. Of those, 40 patients (34%) had a simultaneous positive HR-HPV DNA. Adequate follow up cytology within a one year and a two year period revealed that 18/130 (14%) and 26/130 (20%) of patients had ASC or SIL respectively. Histologic follow-up within one and two years showed 3 patients (2%) and 8 patients (6%) with HSIL or worse. CONCLUSIONS: High risk patients with unsatisfactory anal cytology are not "negative". At least one-third proved to be concomitantly HR-HPV DNA positive with one-fifth showing subsequent cytologic squamous abnormalities and with more than 5% being diagnosed with a high grade intraepithelial lesion within two years. Prompt repeat cytology and/or HR-HPV DNA is recommended for high risk patients with non-diagnostic cytology.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the significance of bizarre cells (cells of squamous origin with a superficial squamous cell-type cytoplasm and characterised by multinucleation that produces bizarre nuclear shapes) in liquid-based cytology (LBC) Papanicoaou (pap) smears with clinical and histological follow-up correlation. Method(s): Fifteen patients, all with LBC samples containing bizarre cells, were identified in routine ThinPrep LBC workload. HPV testing was performed in each case using residual LBC material. Cytological-histological correlations were reviewed. Result(s): All 15 LBC samples contained bizarre cells and tested positive for high-risk HPV types. Ten of the 15 cases were identified as atypical squamous cells - cannot exclude an HSIL (ASC-H) with secondary diagnosis of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), while five cases were identified as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and a subsequent biopsy was recommended. Additionally, 13/15 cases underwent cone biopsy or hysterectomy within 1-11 months, of which 10 showed histologically confirmed HSIL end-points. LSIL was present in three cases. Bizarre cells were identified in the HSIL epithelium of five cone biopsies. Conclusion(s): Identification of bizarre cells in LBC is straightforward and may facilitate diagnosis. The cytology of bizarre cells is associated with HSIL in cone biopsies. We recommend assigning LBC samples containing bizarre cells as ASC-H with secondary diagnosis of LSIL.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: State-of-the-art cervical cancer prevention includes human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among adolescents and screening/treatment of cervical precancer (CIN3/AIS and, less strictly, CIN2) among adults. HPV testing provides sensitive detection of precancer but, to reduce overtreatment, secondary "triage" is needed to predict women at highest risk. Those with the highest-risk HPV types or abnormal cytology are commonly referred to colposcopy; however, expert cytology services are critically lacking in many regions. METHODS: To permit completely automatable cervical screening/triage, we designed and validated a novel triage method, a cytologic risk score algorithm based on computer-scanned liquid-based slide features (FocalPoint, BD, Burlington, NC). We compared it with abnormal cytology in predicting precancer among 1839 women testing HPV positive (HC2, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) in 2010 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Precancer outcomes were ascertained by record linkage. As additional validation, we compared the algorithm prospectively with cytology results among 243 807 women screened at KPNC (2016-2017). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among HPV-positive women, the algorithm matched the triage performance of abnormal cytology. Combined with HPV16/18/45 typing (Onclarity, BD, Sparks, MD), the automatable strategy referred 91.7% of HPV-positive CIN3/AIS cases to immediate colposcopy while deferring 38.4% of all HPV-positive women to one-year retesting (compared with 89.1% and 37.4%, respectively, for typing and cytology triage). In the 2016-2017 validation, the predicted risk scores strongly correlated with cytology (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: High-quality cervical screening and triage performance is achievable using this completely automated approach. Automated technology could permit extension of high-quality cervical screening/triage coverage to currently underserved regions.

AB  - Objective(s): Human papillomavirus (HPV) is in viridae papillomavirus family. These viruses have been classified based on the DNA sequences. At least 120 types of these viruses have been identified. Different types of HPV genotypes are associated with lower genital tract infection. This study aimed to identify the genotypes of HPV that cause vaginal infections in women with infection. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was performed on eighty patients with vaginal infection. Extracting viral DNA was performed automatically using MagCore Nucleic Acid Extractor (made in Taiwan) and MagCor Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction kit (Cartridge code 202) made by MogCore Co. Taiwan, and genotyping the samples was carried out using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in the Light Cycler 96 System (made in Germany) and real-quality relative quantification-HPV infection high-risk (HR)/low-risk (LR) Multiplex Kit made by AB Analitica Co. Italy. Result(s): Among the 80 samples, 30 people (37.5%) were positive for infection with HPV; evaluating the positive genotypes, it was found that of these, 16 people (53.4%) were infected with LR genotypes of HPV, seven patients (23.3%) were infected with only HR HPV genotype, and seven people (23.3%) were infected with both LR and HR genotypes of HPV (coinfection). Conclusion(s): Considering that HPV infection is asymptomatic, and it has a high prevalence in Iran, early diagnosis and prevention of progressing the infection can prevent the malignancies of the uterus. Molecular techniques, particularly real-time PCR, are reliable methods for detecting the HPV infection seven with quite low viral loads.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the differences in perfusion/diffusion/metabolic imaging parameters according to human papilloma virus (HPV) status in the oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OC-OPSCC), separately in primary tumour sites and metastatic lymph nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprised 41 patients with primary OC-OPSCCs and 29 patients with metastatic lymph nodes. The perfusion/diffusion/metabolic imaging parameters were measured at the primary tumour and the largest ipsilateral metastatic lymph node. The quantitative parameters were compared between the HPV-positive and -negative groups. RESULTS: The HPV-positivity was 39% (16 patients) for the primary tumours and 51.7% (15 patients) for the metastatic lymph nodes. Patients with HPV-positive tumours had a lower T stage (p=0.034). The metastatic lymph nodes for the HPV-positive patients were bulkier (p=0.016) and more frequently had cystic morphology (p=0.005). The perfusion parameters were not different, regardless of HPV status. The diffusion parameter (ADC(min), p=0.011) of the metastatic lymph nodes in the HPV-positive groups was lower and metabolic parameter (metabolic tumour volume p=0.035 and total lesion glycolysis p=0.037) were higher than those in HPV-negative groups. CONCLUSION: The diffusion and metabolic parameters of metastatic lymph nodes from OC-OPSCC were different according to HPV status. The perfusion parameters did not clearly represent HPV status.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT), using topically administered photosensitizing agents, is widely approved as a treatment for certain nonmelanoma skin cancers. As a tissue-sparing non-surgical modality, there is great potential for PDT to enhance the choice of therapies available to treat, and potentially prevent, skin cancer. Treatment-specific guidelines have assessed the evidence for various photosensitizing agents and light sources, dosimetry, and evaluate reported adverse effects. Discomfort is frequently experienced during treatment but no analgesia was required in most pivotal lesion-directed studies. Durability of response has been assessed with studies of PDT for basal cell carcinomas (BCC) extending to 5 years and beyond, 2 years for Bowen's disease and up to 1 year for actinic keratoses (AK). Disease-specific guidelines consider the place for topical PDT in routine clinical practice recognizing that PDT is typically office/clinic-based and usually initiated by specialists. Where updated guidelines are awaited, national and international consensus publications offer recommendations, including on the use of daylight to activate the photosensitizer for treating AK. Reviewed studies indicate equivalent efficacy of daylight PDT, but greatly reduced pain compared with conventional PDT. Guidelines and consensus publications also consider the place of PDT in treating skin lesions arising in organ transplant recipients and in the potential for PDT to delay/prevent the development of nonmelanoma skin cancers. There is now a substantial evidence-base to support the use of topical PDT in routine clinical practice with daylight PDT indicated for AK, providing suitable outside climate, whilst conventional PDT remains suitable for AK, Bowen's Disease, superficial and certain thin nodular BCC.Copyright © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the absence of randomized trials, the optimal management for squamous cell cancer of unknown primary in the head and neck region (SCCHN CUP) remains controversial. Current strategies are based on retrospective studies, clinical experience, and institutional policies. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire with a total of 24 questions was created and distributed by the use of an online version (Google Forms(R), Google, Mountain View, CA, USA) as well as a printout version as equivalent option. An email with a link to the survey and the questionnaire as attachment was sent to 361 DEGRO(German Society of Radiation Oncology)-associated departments. Frequency distributions of responses for each question were calculated. The data were also analyzed by type of practice. Representativity of the sample size for the DEGRO was also evaluated. RESULTS: 66 responses were received including answers from 20 (30%) university departments, 16 (24%) non-university institutions, and 30 (46%) radiation oncology practices. 95% of the participants routinely present these cases in an interdisciplinary tumor board and use intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques for SCCHN CUP treatment. Surgery includes neck dissection in 83% and tonsillectomy in 73% of the cases. Human papilloma virus (HPV) status is routinely determined in 82% of the departments. Statistically significant differences between universities and institutions and clinics and practices could be found with respect to positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) utilization, indications for chemotherapy, radiotherapy volumes, and cumulative doses. CONCLUSION: Diagnostics and treatment for SCCHN CUP within the DEGRO remain heterogeneous. A prospective register trial with standard operation procedures is warranted to homogenize and possibly improve management.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1) is a therapeutic target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). After initial promising results with EGFR-targeted therapies such as cetuximab, therapeutic resistance has become a major clinical problem, and new treatment options are therefore necessary. Moreover, the relationship between HER receptors, anti-EGFR therapies, and the human papillomavirus (HPV) status in HNSCC is not fully understood. In contrast to first-generation EGFR inhibitors, afatinib irreversibly inhibits multiple HER receptors simultaneously. Therefore, treatment with afatinib might result in a more pronounced therapeutic benefit, even in patients experiencing cetuximab resistance. In this study, the cytotoxic effect of afatinib as single agent and in combination with cisplatin was investigated in cetuximab-sensitive, intrinsically cetuximab-resistant, and acquired cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cell lines with different HPV status under normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, the influence of cetuximab resistance, HPV, and hypoxia on the expression of HER receptors was investigated. Our results demonstrated that afatinib was able to establish cytotoxicity in cetuximab-sensitive, intrinsically cetuximab-resistant, and acquired cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cell lines, independent of the HPV status. However, cross-resistance between cetuximab and afatinib might be possible. Treatment with afatinib caused a G(0) /G(1) cell cycle arrest as well as induction of apoptotic cell death. Additive to antagonistic interactions between afatinib and cisplatin could be observed. Neither cetuximab resistance nor HPV status significantly influenced the expression of HER receptors in HNSCC cell lines. In contrast, the expression of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 was significantly altered under hypoxia. Oxygen deficiency is a common characteristic of HNSCC tumors, and these hypoxic tumor regions often contain cells that are more resistant to treatment. However, we observed that afatinib maintained its cytotoxic effect under hypoxia. In conclusion, our preclinical data support the hypothesis that afatinib might be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat patients with HNSCC experiencing intrinsic or acquired cetuximab resistance.

AB  - Background:Self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) offered to women who do not participate in cervical cancer screening is an increasingly popular method to increase screening coverage. The rationale behind self-sampling is that unscreened women harbour a high proportion of undetected precancer lesions. Here, we compare the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (>=CIN2) detection rate between non-attenders who participated in self-sampling and women attending routine screening. Method(s):A total of 23 632 women who were qualified as non-attenders in the Copenhagen Region were invited for HPV-based self-sampling. Of these, 4824 women returned a self-sample, and HPV-positive women were referred for cytology and HPV co-testing as follow-up. The entire cohort and a reference cohort (3347 routinely screened women) were followed for histopathology confirmed >=CIN2. Odds ratio (OR) and the relative positive predictive value of >=CIN2 detection between the two populations were estimated. Result(s):Women participating in self-sampling had a higher >=CIN2 detection than women undergoing routine cytology-based screening (OR=1.83, 95% CI: 1.21-2.77) and a similar detection as routinely screened women tested with cytology and HPV testing (OR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.75-1.40). The positive predictive value for >=CIN2 was higher in screening non-attenders than in routinely HPV- and cytology-screened screened women (36.5% vs 25.6%, respectively). Conclusion(s):Self-sampling offered to non-attenders showed higher detection rates for >=CIN2 than routine cytology-based screening, and similar detection rates as HPV and cytology co-testing. This reinforces the importance of self-sampling for screening non-attenders in organised cervical cancer screening.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence shows a causal role of high-risk humane papillomavirus (HPV) infections in the development of head and neck cancer. A recent case report shows two patients suffering from tonsillar cancer without any risk factors apart from their work as gynecologists doing laser ablations and loop electrosurgical excision procedures (LEEP). The aim of the present investigation is to evaluate whether surgical plume resulting from routine LEEPs of HSIL of the cervix uteri might be contaminated with the DNA of high-risk HPV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective pilot study is done at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University of Lubeck, Germany. The primary outcome was defined as HPV subtype in resected cone and in surgical plume resulting from LEEPs of HSIL of the cervix uteri. Plume resulting from LEEPs was analyzed using a Whatman FTA Elute Indicating Card which was placed in the tube of an exhaust suction device used to remove the resulting aerosols. For detection of HPV and analysis of its subtype, the novel EUROArray HPV test was performed. Resected cones of LEEPs were evaluated separately for HPV subtypes. RESULTS: Four samples of surgical plume resulting from routine LEEPs indicated contamination with high-risk HPV and showed the same HPV subtype as identified in the resected cones. CONCLUSION: Surgical plume resulting from routine LEEPs for HSIL of the cervix uteri has the risk of contamination with high-risk HPV. Further investigations of infectiousness of surgical plume are necessary for evaluation of potential hazards to involved healthcare professionals.

AB  - While a variety of human papillomavirus (HPV) tests and surrogate markers are available, currently there is no consensus on the best detection method(s) that should be used to identify HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas and serve as a standard test (or tests) for routine diagnostic use. As we begin to consider using the results of HPV testing for clinical purposes beyond simple prognostication, such as making decisions on treatment dose or duration or for targeted therapies that may be highly dependent on viral-mediated pathways, we need to be more rigorous in assessing and ensuring the performance of the test (or tests) used. Here we provide an overview of the platforms and technologies, including the strengths and limitations of each test, and discuss what steps are needed to generate confidence in their performance for use in clinical practice.

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is a cause of cervical cancer development. The addition of hrHPV testing to cervical cancer screening and monitoring of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia treatment improves the efficacy of screening and treatment, respectively. Self-sampling for hrHPV testing seems a promising tool for increasing patient participation in cervical cancer screening. In this project, 1198 cervical swabs obtained by physicians and 176 cervicovaginal swabs obtained by self-sampling (not collected in parallel) were analyzed for the presence of 14 hrHPV genotypes using three commercially available assays in comparison. HPV DNA was detected in 21.2% of all samples (21% of cervical swabs and 22.7% of cervicovaginal swabs). The cobas 4800 HPV Test was the most sensitive (0.983) and specific (0.992) for hrHPV detection overall. The PapilloCheck HPV-Screening and LMNX Genotyping Kit HPV GP had comparable specificity with that of the cobas (0.989 and 0.955, respectively), but lesser sensitivity (0.897 and 0.909, respectively). In physician-obtained cervical swabs, the cobas showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (0.980 and 0.994, respectively) for hrHPV detection, whereas in cervicovaginal swabs, the cobas had the highest sensitivity (1.00), but the PapilloCheck had the highest specificity (0.993). In conclusion, all of the detection methods evaluated were highly sensitive and specific for hrHPV detection from both clinician-collected cervical swabs and self-sampled cervicovaginal swabs.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology

AB  - Ninety years ago, at the Battle Creek conference, Papanicolaou introduced cervical exfoliative cytology. Since then, the "Pap test" has come a long way. The discovery of a causal relationship between cervical carcinoma and HPV infection opened the door for molecular testing and immunomarkers for HPV. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, 1988, established quality assurance and quality control programs to monitor performance of cytology laboratories. The Bethesda System for reporting cervical cytology laid the foundations for cervical cytology education, implementation of management guidelines, and further research on cervical carcinogenesis. HPV vaccine penetration in both genders remains 62% or less.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As cervical cancer screening shifts from cytology to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, a major question is the clinical value of identifying individual HPV types. We aimed to validate Onclarity (Becton Dickinson Diagnostics, Sparks, MD), a nine-channel HPV test recently approved by the FDA, by assessing (i) the association of Onclarity types/channels with precancer/cancer; (ii) HPV type/channel agreement between the results of Onclarity and cobas (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA), another FDA-approved test; and (iii) Onclarity typing for all types/channels compared to typing results from a research assay (linear array [LA]; Roche). We compared Onclarity to histopathology, cobas, and LA. We tested a stratified random sample (n = 9,701) of discarded routine clinical specimens that had tested positive by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD). A subset had already been tested by cobas and LA (n = 1,965). Cervical histopathology was ascertained from electronic health records. Hierarchical Onclarity channels showed a significant linear association with histological severity. Onclarity and cobas had excellent agreement on partial typing of HPV16, HPV18, and the other 12 types as a pool (sample-weighted kappa value of 0.83); cobas was slightly more sensitive for HPV18 and slightly less sensitive for the pooled high-risk types. Typing by Onclarity showed excellent agreement with types and groups of types identified by LA (kappa values from 0.80 for HPV39/68/35 to 0.97 for HPV16). Onclarity typing results corresponded well to histopathology and to an already validated HPV DNA test and could provide additional clinical typing if such discrimination is determined to be clinically desirable.

AB  - There is currently no large sample data of cytology, high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), and colposcopy results of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) in women who underwent hysterectomy and those who did not. We aim to explore the values of cytology, hrHPV, and colposcopy reports in detecting VaIN. A retrospective study of women diagnosed with VaIN by colposcopy-directed biopsy was performed at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, China, between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014. A total of 529 cases of VaIN were diagnosed, including 16.1% VaIN2/3 and 83.9% VaIN1. The ratio of VaIN2/3 in VaIN among patients after hysterectomy and with an intact uterus was 35.1% and 12.0%, respectively. The sensitivity of cytology for VaIN2/3 in only, concomitant, and posthysterectomy VaIN was 42.1%, 80.0%, and 80.8%, respectively. The sensitivity of hrHPV and cytology/hrHPV cotesting for VaIN2/3 in patients with an intact uterus versus those after hysterectomy was 93.5% versus 92.3% and 92.0% versus 100.0%, respectively. Notably, 13.3% of the patients with VaIN and 9.7% of the patients with VaIN2/3 underwent hysterectomy for noncervical diseases. The sensitivity of cytology and hrHPV for VaIN is noninferior to that of CIN2+, and thus these methods can help in the early detection of VaIN effectively.

AB  - Background: According to international guidelines, HPV DNA tests represent a valid alternative to Pap Test for primary cervical cancer screening, provided that they guarantee balanced clinical sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe lesions. The aim of this study was to assess whether REALQUALITY RQ-HPV Screen, a new assay based on real time PCR that targets the E6-E7 region of 14 high-risk human papillomaviruses, meets the criteria for primary cervical cancer screening. Method(s): As required by guidelines, a non-inferiority test was conducted to compare the clinical performance of the test under evaluation with that of a clinically validated reference test (Hybrid Capture 2, HC2). The reproducibility of the device was assessed as well. The clinical samples used to test the hypothesis of non-inferiority and to asses reproducibility comprised 910 and 536 cervical specimens respectively. All specimens were originating from a population-based screening cohort. Result(s): The study demonstrates that both the clinical sensitivity and specificity of REALQUALITY RQ-HPV Screen are non-inferior to those of HC2. In addition, an adequate intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility has been reached by the test.

AB  - Background Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and the seventh most common cancer overall, accounting for an estimated 300 000 annual deaths. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the second most common cause of cervical cancer worldwide. HPV screening is not a common practice in Pakistan. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HPV and HPV types in women with a normal cytology of the cervix living in the upper and lower regions of Punjab, Pakistan, and to analyze the risk factors for HPV in this region. Methods PCR analysis was performed for 1011 female patients with a normal cytology of the cervix from various districts of Punjab Province, Pakistan. Risk factors for the acquisition of HPV were studied. High-risk HPV types (HPV16 and HPV18) were detected using the Abbott Real Time HR HPV test. To determine the genotype, partial L1 region sequences of HPV-positive samples were subjected to sequencing using MY/09/MY11 primers, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using CLC software. Results The study found a 4.74% prevalence of HPV, with the most frequent HPV type found being the low-risk HPV6 (in 25% of infected individuals), followed by HPV55 (22.9%), HPV11 (20.8%), and high-risk types HPV45 (12.5%), HPV33 (8.33%), HPV18 (6.25%), and HPV16 (4.16%). Phylogenetic analysis of all HPV types in this study showed 80-99% nucleotide identity with types related to the same species. The sequences were clustered with China, India, Mexico, Iran, Slovenia, and Germany, showing the diversity in origin of the various genotypes prevalent in Pakistan. Conclusions In this population with a normal cervical cytology, the prevalence of high-risk HPV types was very low. The major prevalent HPV genotype in Punjab Province of Pakistan was the low-risk HPV type 6, followed by HPV type 55. Sequencing of the partial L1 region suggested that the region was highly conserved in all reported sequences. This study highlights the need to conduct robust epidemiological studies in the region and to develop regular HPV screening so that the situation does not reach an alarming stage resulting in cervical cancer.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Different studies assessed the role of inflammation in malignancy of different organs. Prostatitis has been suggested as a cause of cancer and BPH. Till now, more than 100 types of human Papilloma virus (HPV) are recognized including low and high-risk groups for carcinogenesis. Among them HPV-16 and HPV-18 have shown further association with cancer. Regarding the presence of E6 and E7 in HPV and ability for modification of basal epithelial cells, related role in prostate cancer (as well as cervical and genital malignancies) is hypothesized. The aim of this study was to determine the association of HPV-16 and HPV-18 with prostate cancer and malignancy degree. Method(s): A total of 75 consecutive paraffin-embedded blocks including 50 samples with primary prostate cancer and 25 samples with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) as control were studied. Amplisense kit was used for replication at real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine genotypes of HPV-16 and HPV-18. DNA purity was assessed by Nano Drop. Result(s): The results of real-time PCR demonstrated that none of the samples of BPH and prostate cancer had amplification of HPV DNA. Conclusion(s): The results revealed that HPV-16 and HPV-18 are not causes of prostate cancer.Copyright © 2018, Kerman University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Mutational load and immune expression signatures have previously been established as efficacy biomarkers in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) trials. It is important to know the value of these biomarkers for predicting outcome after concurrent chemoradiation (cCRTX), for defining patient subgroups likely to benefit from ICI/cCRTX combinations. Method(s): FFPE tumor samples from 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN from a retrospective DKTK-ROG biomarker trial were available for this study. All patients had been treated with standard definitive cCRTX. Mutation profiling was performed using a large gene panel targeting the complete coding sequence of 327 genes. Mutational load was calculated based on the number of somatic nonsynonymous mutations per megabase (Mb). Immune mRNA profiles were determined using the nanoString PanCancer Immune panel. Mutational load was correlated with immune profile and outcome. Result(s): The mean number of somatic mutations per Mb was 4.9 (range 0-36), in line with previous reports from TCGA/ICGC studies. No association was found between mutational load and HPV status. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed a significant correlation of high mutational load with reduced OS (HR for death: 1.9; 95%-CI: 1.1- 3.3, P= 0.028). Conversely, detection of immune profiles linked to Tcell functions was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.3; 95%-CI: 0.1-0.9, P= 0.033). There was a significant interaction between mutational load and immune profiles in their effects on outcome (P = 0.03). High mutational load was associated with low Tcell infiltration, IFN-gamma signature scores and expression of genes involved in T-cell functions including PD-L1 and LAG3, indicative of immune dysfunctions in neoantigen-rich tumors. Conclusion(s): We established mutational load and T-cell immune signatures as interdependent predictors of the efficacy of cCRTX, thereby providing first evidence that both parameters might serve for selection of patients with benefit from combined cCRTX/ICI regimens.

AB  - Background: Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-driven head and neck cancer (HNSCC) is associated with good prognosis. The prognostic value of HPV-DNA and p16 IHC was recently reported by this consortium. Discordance between HPV and p16 status is consistently observed impacting patient stratification and treatment outcome. We sought to overcome this limitation by developing a next-generation methylome-based classifier of HPVdriven HNSCC. Method(s): HPV-DNA and p16 status of a DKTK-ROG multicenter retrospective cohort of patients (n = 194) with oropharynx cancer (OPC), oral cavity- and hypopharynx cancer (non-OPC), homogenously treated with surgery and adjuvant cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy (RCHT), was employed as a training set. Five validation cohorts were utilized including DKTKROG patients with definitive RCHT (n = 110), three additional RCHT cohorts from Heidelberg, Dresden, Munich (n = 222) and The Cancer Genome Atlas - HNSCC cohort (TCGA, n = 206). Overall methylome data from 732 samples including two different sources (FFPE/FrFr) and platforms (Illumina 450K and EPIC 850K) were studied. Result(s): A 24-probe set methylome-based classifier of HPV-driven HNSCC was discovered (HPV-M) to significantly correlate with improved clinical outcomes: HR for local recurrence (range 0.11-0.19), disease progression (range 0.16-0.29) and overall survival (OS, range 0.19-0.42) were significant in all cohorts (p < 0.05). Notably, HPV-M+ classification was superior to HPV-DNA+ status or p16+ IHC in predicting OS in all cohorts independent of tumor localization (OPC/non-OPC). Likewise, HPV-M showed a strong correlation with HPV-DNA and p16 status (p < 0.0001). Across cohorts ~ 10% discordance between HPV-M and HPV-DNA or p16 status was found, respectively. Among these patients (n = 71), OS was significantly reduced in patients with HPV-M negative vs. positive tumors (p < 0.009). Conclusion(s): We present a novel robust and independent methylome-based classifier of HPV-driven HNSCC that could be instrumental for accurate patient stratification in the era of de-escalation trials.

AB  - #Objectives Germany plans to implement an organised screening programme for cervical cancer screening. This involves a change from the annual offer of a Pap test to a combined Pap/HPV test every three years for women aged 35 and older. Also, regular invitations containing a decision aid will be sent out to all women. The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) was commissioned to develop the invitation letter and the decision aid, and to have them tested by users. One focus was the communication of benefits and harms. Method A systematic search was performed to analyse the benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening. Additionally, the long-term effects were modelled based on an existing and validated decision analysis tool. The invitation letter and the decision aid were tested in qualitative focus groups (32 participants) and an online survey (2014 participants). The process also included a public commenting procedure. Results Most users perceived the decision aid to be informative, helpful and balanced. The majority found the information on possible overtreatment to be relevant. Healthcare professionals were more reluctant to provide information on harms in the decision aid, fearing it might lead to lower participation in screening. The survey showed that the decision aid only had little impact on screening intention. Most women consider the benefits of screening to outweigh the harms. The majority would participate in the screening programme, despite the possibility of overtreatment and the potential harms of conization. Conclusions Although cervical cancer screening can lead to a substantial reduction of cancer morbidity and mortality, possible harms should also be communicated in a decision aid. Doing so did not lead to a substantial difference in the acceptance of the screening programme.

AB  - Objectives: In low-and middle-income countries, access to cervical cancer prevention services remains limited, despite a high burden of disease. To address this, Population Services International and its local network member in Uganda, the Programme for Accessible Health Communication and Education, or PACE, initiated a community-based program using human papilloma virus (HPV) testing as part of a screen and treat model in two peri-urban/ rural settings. Method(s): The program aimed to screen 5,000 women 30-49 years in Soroti and Ibanda regions. Trained community health agents conducted household visits to inform women about HPV screening. Eligible women could collect a sample at home, or provide a sample at a local clinic on a walk-in basis. All samples were collected daily and transported to a local clinic for processing. Women retrieved their test results during a weekly treatment outreach unit, where they were triaged according to their HPV results. HPV+ women were provided a visual inspection of the cervix (VIA), and then offered cryotherapy or referral, as indicated. Result(s): A total of 5,342 women 30-49 years were screened using CareHPV (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) at the two program sites. The high-risk HPV positivity rate among those tested was 15% (806 women). When offered the option of self-sampling at home versus clinic-based sampling, 93% of women (4968) preferred to provide a vaginal, self-collected sample. Dedicated outreach units offering treatment were successful in treating 99% of women who were HPV+ and cryotherapy-eligible. Nine HPV+ women identified with large lesions, and thus ineligible for cryotherapy, were referred for higher levels of care. Conclusion(s): As HPV testing becomes more widely available, there is a need to identify optimal service delivery models to maximize treatment and linkage to care following screening. Treating HPV+ women using a dedicated treatment outreach model, is an innovative 'screen and treat' scenario, and was successful in treating the majority of women identified with high-risk HPV types and in whom a large lesion or cancer was ruled out by visual inspection. Self-collection of vaginal samples was overwhelmingly preferred among women in this setting, signaling a strong advantage of HPV testing over clinic-based approaches.

AB  - Objective: To understand the hrHPVs distribution of cervical cancer in China will help determine a reasonable range of HPV genotypes for screening purpose. This study was to investigate the prevalence and genotypes of HPV in a large cohort of cervical cancer samples, which will shed some light on HPV-based cervical cancer screening in China. Method(s): Consecutive received 1000 cases of surgical specimens of cervical cancer at Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University were enrolled from August 1, 2015 to April 30, 2017. Totally 951 cases with enough tumor tissues for further testing. DNA samples were extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues using Qiagen FFPE DNA kit (Qiagen, Germany). 21-genotyping was performed by BMRT assay-a real time PCR based kit (BioPerfectus Tech Company, Taizhou, China). The HPV genotypes included13 hrHPV, 4potential hrHPV and 4 low risk HPV. Result(s): The most common HPV genotypes found in 951 cervical cancer samples were HPV16/18 (83.91%, 15.35%), followed by HPV58, 59, 56, 52 and so on. No lrHPV was found in cervical cancer without simultaneously infected by hrHPV. In the rest of 79 HPV16/18 negative cases, 29 were HPV negative cases. HPV58, 31, 26 was positive in 15, 7, 4 cases, respectively. HPV26/68/73, belonging to potential hrHPV, were positive independently from hrHPV. HPV16 accounted for most of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (64.16%), adenocarcinoma (ADC) (44.92%) and adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ADSC) (46.67%), while HPV18 mostly concentrated in ADC (23.1%) and ADSC (23.8%). In HPV16/18 negative patients, there were 12 cases of HPV58, 7 cases of HPV31 and 9 cases of HPV negative in 52 cases of SCC; among 22 cases of ADC, 18 cases in HPV negative, and 1 cases in each of HPV26/56/58/66. The correlation coefficients of HPV16, 18 and other 12 high-risk types before and after operation were 0.61, 0.74 and 0.62 (P <0.01). Conclusion(s): HPV16 and 18 genotypes infection accounted for 91.7% in cervical cancer, suggesting that hrHPV genotyping detection to distinguish HPV16/18 is of great significance for cervical cancer screening. The potential hrHPV can be present in cervical cancer alone, especially the high positive rate of HPV26, indicating that detection of middle risk HPV can help reduce missed diagnosis. Low-risk HPV is not associated with cervical cancer.

AB  - Introduction & Objectives: Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) represent the majority of malignant penile tumours. About 50% of all SCCs are associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV), but the value of HPV in terms of prognosis is controversially discussed. Furthermore, the knowledge of molecular biological processesin tumourigenesis and metastasis with regard to HPV is limited. The aim of this international multicentre study is to examine prognostic markers for penile SCC. Material(s) and Method(s): We included 123 patients from Russia and Germany. The tumours have been classified according to the novel 2016 WHO classification. HPV genotyping and immunohistochemical staining of p16 was performed. Clinical data were correlated to the histological subtype and HPV status (high risk HPV negative or positive). RNA was isolated from FFPE tissues as well as paired normal tissue (skin from the penis). For each subtype, metastasised and non-metastasised tumours were selected. MicroRNA microarray analysis was performed using the Agilent platform. Selected miRNAs have been validated by qPCR. Result(s): In general, no difference in cancer specific (CSS) and progression free survival (PFS) was observed with regard to HPV. The CSS was associated with histological subtype, whereby the worst outcome was observed in HPV-related basaloid carcinomas and the best in non- HPV-related warty carcinomas. Considering the HPV status within the histological subtype, HPV-related patients exhibited a better CSS and PFS. MicroRNA-profiles of PeCa subtypes varied significantly. Within the subtypes, microRNAs distinguished between tumour and corresponding normal tissue as well as metastasised and non-metastasised tumours (usual type, 40 microRNAs; p<0.05; FC>1.5; basaloid carcinoma, 90 microRNAs; p<0.05; FC>1.5). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that the histological subtype combined with HPV status but not the HPV status alone determines the prognosis of the disease. The differentially expressed microRNAs could serve as molecular markers for prognosis and deliver further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of penile SCCs.

AB  - Background: CTGF plays a central role in tissue remodeling and has emerged as an attractive novel therapeutic target. We sought to investigate the impact of CTGF methylation status (CTGF-M) in predicting outcome of HNSCC patients undergoing RCHT. Method(s): CTGF-M was discovered by applying Illumina 450K/850K arrays to DNA extracted from FFPE material of patients homogeneously treated with surgery followed by adjuvant cisplatin-based RCHT in frame of the DKTK-ROG multicenter retrospective trial (n = 194, training cohort). Methylation probes correlating with overall survival (OS) and progression were identified using random forest. Validation was done in 4 cohorts including DKTK-ROG definitive RCHT (n = 110) and 3 RCHT cohorts from Heidelberg, Dresden and Munich (n = 222). CTGF-M and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 206) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) as a function of CTGF-M. Result(s): Increased methylation of 2 probes (mapping to CTGF 3'UTR and gene body) was associated with significantly improved OS in the training cohort (HR = 0.51, p = 0.044) and the validation cohort (HR = 0.67, p = 0.016), in multivariate cox regressions adjusting for HPV status, age, T and N stages, location and treatment (adjuvant vs definitive RCHT). In the TCGA, probes' methylation was significantly inversely correlated with CTGF gene expression (r = -0.18 and -0.51, p < 0.05). 1843 DEGs were found at FDR < 0.05 as a function of CTGF-M. Pathways mapping to tissue remodeling were significantly enriched for among downregulated genes in CTGF hypermethylated tumors. Increased CTGF methylation was inversely correlated with the mesenchymal subtype mRNA gene signature (r = -0.21, p = 0.0026) and correlated with the atypical subtype (r = 0.32, p = 0.000002). Conclusion(s): Implementation of CtGf-M in routine diagnostic is feasible and correlates well with CTGF gene-expression levels and activation of tissue remodeling pathways. Therefore, CTGF-M might be instructive for stratifying HNSCC patients for CTGF targeting therapies. CTGF emerges as a promising prognostic marker independently of HPV status.

AB  - Purpose: Head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection represents a distinct biological and prognostic subtype compared to the HPV-negative form. Prior studies suggest a correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of primary tumor lesion and HPV status in HNSCC. In this meta-analysis, we compared the average ADC of primary lesion between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. Method(s): A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and Embase was performed. Studies comparing the average ADC on echo-planar DWI of primary tumor lesions between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC were included. The standardized mean difference was calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Tau-squared estimates of total heterogeneity and Higgins inconsistency index (I2 test) were determined. Result(s): A total of five studies, pooling data of 264 patients, were included for meta-analysis. Among these five studies, three had included oral cavity, hypopharyngeal, and/or laryngeal HNSCC in addition to oropharyngeal subsite. Primary lesions were comprised of 185 HPV-negative and 79 HPV-positive HNSCC. The meta-analysis showed lower average ADC values in HPV-positive HNSCC compared to the HPV-negative form, with a standardized mean difference of 0.961 (95% confidence interval 0.644-1.279; p < 0.0001). Since there was no significant heterogeneity in analysis (p = 0.3852), both random- and fixed-effects models resulted in the same estimates of overall effect. Conclusion(s): HPV-positive HNSCC primary lesions have a lower average ADC compared to the HPV-negative form, highlighting the potential application of quantitative diffusion magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive imaging biomarker for prediction of HPV status.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Aims: Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer among women, worldwide. HIV-positive women tend to have persistent infection and infection with multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) types. There is a need for affordable HPV DNA tests as viable alternatives to the existing costly commercial assays. The aim of the study was to establish PGMY-CHUV reverse hybridization assay as a cost-effective tool for HPV genotyping. Study Design: This was a prospective study conducted in a tertiary care centre from March 2011 to July 2012. Subjects and Methods: Fifty cervical brush samples from HIV-infected women and 43 WHO reference samples were tested by both the CHUV assay and linear array (LA). Result(s): The CHUV assay in comparison to the LA showed a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 52% and a moderate agreement for all samples that were compared. However, most high-risk HPV types were identified amongst the clinical samples, and the entire range of genotypes in the WHO reference panel was detected. Statistical Analysis: The accuracy indices such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated. The level of agreement (kappa value) between the two assays was also calculated. Conclusion(s): The CHUV assay had an acceptable sensitivity, but it lacked specificity for HPV detection. Despite the lower rates of detection of multiple infections from clinical samples, better results were obtained with the WHO reference samples and the ability of the assay to identify the entire range of genotypes suggests that it can be an efficient tool for genotyping.Copyright © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Treatment options remain limited for patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), while there are still concerns over the consequences of long-term corticosteroid use. A few studies have suggested a role for B cell-driven autoimmune liver injury in AIH. This multicentre, international retrospective cohort study from the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of rituximab in difficult-to-manage AIH. Method(s): Clinical data from 22 patients who received rituximab between 2007 and 2017 were collected from centres in the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. Clinical response was assessed using changes in biochemical and immunological parameters up to 24 months post-rituximab infusion. In addition, we compared the doses of prednisolone used 3 months before and 12 months after treatment, and assessed freedom from AIH flares over the post-treatment period. Result(s): Twenty-two patients with type-1 AIH were included, with a median age of 40 years at diagnosis (range 19-79); 15/22 (68%) were female and 18/22 (82%) were Caucasian. The median period from diagnosis to the end of follow-up in these patients was 11 years (range 3-28). Values of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and albumin improved significantly following rituximab therapy, and were sustained for up to 2 years (all p <<0.001). Prednisolone doses were significantly reduced by 12 months post-treatment (p = 0.003), with 13/21 (62%) patients having a dose reduction. Over a median post-treatment follow-up period of 6 years (range 1-10), 5 patients developed AIH flares at a median of 22 months post-treatment, giving an estimated 71% freedom from AIH flare at 2 years. Four of these patients received a second course of treatment, of whom 2 had subsequent further flares. No serious adverse events attributable to rituximab were recorded. Conclusion(s): In patients with difficult-to-manage AIH, rituximab appears to be clinically effective and well tolerated. Rituximab was associated with sustained improvements in serum liver tests, an absence of clinical disease flares, and a reduction in prednisolone dose. Controlled trials are warranted to further evaluate B cell-targeting therapies in patients with AIH. Lay summary: Autoimmune hepatitis is an autoimmune condition of the liver, usually treated with medications that suppress the immune system, such as steroids. However, some patients do not respond to this treatment. We analysed the safety and efficacy of rituximab in patients who were not responding to first- or second-line therapies. Rituximab was safe and improved liver blood tests in 70% of patients over a 2-year follow-up period, while enabling steroid doses to be reduced in two-thirds of patients, which is a very positive clinical outcome.Copyright © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Introduction: Romania has the highest incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer in Europe. The objective was to estimate the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) genotypes and to evaluate the role of certain socio-behavioral factors in acquiring viral infection, in a cohort of Romanian women with negative Pap. Methodology: In a prevalence study 611 women (aged 17-58 years) with negative Pap, with no known history of atypical cytology and valid HPV test were included. Each participant completed a questionnaire containing data on socio-behavioral factors. From 344 women aged between 30-58 years, 63 were randomly selected for a second examination (conventional cytology and HPV detection and genotyping) after twelve months. Result(s): Of the 611 women, 19.80% were HPV positive, 14.73% infected with hrHPV. Differences in the prevalence of hrHPV (17.60% versus 12.50%) as single (13.01% vs 9.01%) and multiple infections (9.71% vs 3.49%) were noted between women under the age of 30 and above. Among socio-behavioral factors, marital status and multiple sexual partners correlate with HPV and hrHPV infection. At follow-up, from 34 HPV negative cases, 10 changed to positive (5 hrHPV), while 2 developed abnormal cytology. Out of the 29 HPV positive cases, 12 cleared the HPV infection and 17 retested positive of which 4 worsened their cytology. Conclusion(s): In Romania, HPV infection is common in women with negative cytology. HPV genotyping is of epidemiological importance because the distribution of hrHPV types can determine the impact of prophylactic vaccines and the necessity of HPV testing as screening method.Copyright © 2019 Plesa et al.

AB  - Women above the age of 35 years will receive a co-testing of HPV test (quality assurance criteria) and cytology every three years. Younger women from 20 years on will be offered yearly Pap smears as before. Every five years the health insurance companies will send out information letters to all insurants. Non-participants can have the possibility of self-sampling. Cytology or HPV triage will be used to decide about admission to colposcopy. High-grade cytological findings or a positive HPV 16/18 test will lead to immediate colposcopy. After a histological diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia the patients will have a LLETZ-procedure (large loop excision of the transformation zone) or laser conisation. Follow-up (test of cure) after 6, 12 and 24 months will be done with co-testing of HPV and cytology as well. After two screening rounds i. e. after six years we will be able to observe the first effects of the new screening programme on the incidence of cervical cancer in Germany.Copyright © 2019 Mediengruppe Oberfranken - Fachverlage GmbH & Co.

AB  - Purpose: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of common cancers worldwide. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) is increasingly used for diagnosing and staging, as well as for monitoring of treatment of HNSCC. PET parameters like maximum and mean standard uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) can predict the behavior of HNSCC. The purpose of this study was to analyze possible associations between these PET parameters and clinically relevant histopathological features in patients with HNSCC. Procedures: Overall, 22 patients, mean age, 55.2 +/- 11.0 years, with different HNSCC were acquired. Low grade (G1/2) tumors were diagnosed in 10 cases (45 %) and high grade (G3) tumor in 12 (55 %) patients. In all cases, whole body PET was performed. For this study, the following specimen stainings were performed: MIB-1 staining (KI 67 expression), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor suppressor protein p53, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, and human papilloma virus (p16 expression). All stained specimens were digitalized and analyzed by using the ImageJ software 1.48v. Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) was used to analyze associations between investigated parameters. P values <0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. Result(s): P16-negative tumors showed statistically significant higher SUVmax (rho = 0.006) and SUVmean values (rho = 0.002) in comparison to p16-positive carcinomas. No significant differences were identified in the analyzed parameters between poorly and moderately/well-differentiated tumors. In overall sample, there were no statistically significant correlations between the [18F]FDG-PET and histopathological parameters. Also, in G1/2 tumors, no significant correlations were identified. In G3 carcinomas, cell count correlated statistical significant with SUVmax (p = 0.580, P = 0.048) and SUVmean (rho = 0.587, P = 0.045). Conclusion(s): Associations between [18F]FDG-PET parameters and different histopathological features in HNSCC depend significantly on tumor grading. In G1/2 carcinomas, there were no significant correlations between [18F]FDG-PET parameters and histopathology. In G3 lesions, SUVmax and SUVmean reflect tumor cellularity.Copyright © 2018, World Molecular Imaging Society.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are responsible for >99% of cervical cancers. Molecular diagnostic tests based on the detection of viral DNA or RNA have low positive predictive values for the identification of cancer or precancerous lesions. Triage with the Papanicolaou test lacks sensitivity; and even when combined with molecular detection of high-risk HPV, this results in a significant number of unnecessary colposcopies. We have developed a broad-range detection test of HPV transcripts to take a snapshot of the transcriptome of 16 high-risk or putative high-risk HPVs in cervical lesions (HPVs 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, and 82). The purpose of this novel molecular assay, named HPV RNA-Seq, is to detect and type HPV-positive samples and to determine a combination of HPV reads at certain specific viral spliced junctions that can better correlate with high-grade cytology, reflecting the presence of precancerous cells. In a proof-of-concept study conducted on 55 patients, starting from cervical smears, we have shown that HPV RNA-Seq can detect papillomaviruses with performances comparable to a widely used HPV reference molecular diagnostic kit; and a combination of the number of sequencing reads at specific early versus late HPV transcripts can be used as a marker of high-grade cytology, with encouraging diagnostic performances as a triage test.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology

AB  - Objective To examine the test performance of careHPV, Hybrid Capture2 (HC2) and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for detection of cytologically diagnosed high-grade cervical lesions or cancer (HSIL+). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC), Tanzania. Population Women attending routine cervical cancer screening. Method We enrolled 4080 women (25-60 years) in the study. The women were interviewed on lifestyle habits, and tested for HIV. A cervical specimen for careHPV testing (performed at ORCI and KCMC), and a liquid-based cytology sample for HPV DNA detection using HC2 (performed at Tuebingen University Hospital, Germany) and for cytology assessment (performed at Vejle Hospital, Denmark) were obtained at a gynecological examination. Subsequently, VIA was performed. With cytology as gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of careHPV, HC2, and VIA for detection of HSIL+ were calculated. Results Altogether, 23.6% had a positive careHPV test, 19.1% had positive HC2 test, and 6.3% had a positive VIA test. The sensitivity/specificity was 88.9%/78.9% for careHPV and 91.1%/ 83.7%, for HC2. VIA showed a low sensitivity of 31.1% but a high specificity (94.6%) for detection of HSIL+. The sensitivity of careHPV, HC2 and VIA was higher among younger women, and among HIV positive women. VIA triage of careHPV positive women improved specificity, but sensitivity dropped to 27%. Conclusion Our results confirm the low sensitivity of VIA for detection of HSIL+ and further document that careHPV test is promising as a primary screening method for cervical-cancer prevention in low-resource regions. A suitable triage test has to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Katanga et al.

AB  - Introduction: Cervical cancer remains an important public health problem in Chinese women owing to the lack of a national screening program. The aim of the present study was to evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) and Papanicolaou (Pap) test results preceding the histologic diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3) in China's largest College of American Pathologists-certified clinical laboratory. Material(s) and Method(s): All cases of CIN2/3 histologically diagnosed from January 2011 to August 2016 were retrieved from the pathology department records. The Pap cytology and HPV test results from the 6 months before the CIN2/3 diagnoses were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 5699 patients with histologically diagnosed CIN2/3 had previous Pap and/or HPV Hybrid Capture 2 testing results within the previous 6 months. The average age was 39.5 years (range, 16-82 years). Of these patients, 4288 had Pap test findings (average, 1.5 months) available. The results were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion in 44.1%, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion in 20.0%, atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, in 16.0%, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, in 12.3%, atypical glandular cells in 0.7%, and negative in 6.9%. Of the 5699 patients, 2546 had HPV Hybrid Capture 2 test results (average, 1.4 months) available. Of these, 91.7% had positive results and 8.3% had negative results. Of 1135 patients with both previous Pap and HPV results, 7.1% had negative HPV results and 8.0% had negative Pap results (P = 0.38). Only 21 patients (1.9%) had double negative results. Conclusion(s): The present study has reported the previous results of HPV testing and Pap cytology for patients with high-grade cervical squamous precursor lesions in a population of women in China who had not undergone intensive previous screening. Both high-risk HPV and Pap cytology had similar negative testing rates for these women, although double negative results were less common. These results support the value of combined testing in the detection of cervical cancer precursors.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Cytopathology

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a prognostic model of integrating whole-tumour apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from pretreatment diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping in predicting the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for women with stage IB-IV cervical cancer following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed three prospectively collected cohorts comprising 300 patients with stage IB-IV cervical cancer treated with CCRT in 2007-2014 and filtered 134 female patients who underwent MR imaging at 3.0 T for final analysis (age, 24-92 years; median, 54 years). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the whole-tumour ADC histogram parameters, HPV genotyping and relevant clinical variables in predicting OS and DFS. The dataset was randomly split into training (n = 88) and testing (n = 46) datasets for construction and independent bootstrap validation of the models. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 69 months (range, 9-126 months). Non-squamous cell type, ADC(10) <0.77 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, T3-4, M1 stage and high-risk HPV status were selected to generate a model, in which the OS and DFS for the low, intermediate and high-risk groups were significantly stratified (p < 0.0001). The prognostic model improved the prediction significantly compared with the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage for both the training and independent testing datasets (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic model based on integrated clinical and imaging data could be a useful clinical biomarker to predict OS and DFS in patients with stage IB-IV cervical cancer treated with CCRT. KEY POINTS: * ADC (10) is the best prognostic factor among ADC parameters in cervical cancer treated with CCRT * A novel prognostic model was built based on histology, ADC (10) , T and M stage and HPV status * The prognostic model outperforms FIGO stage in the survival prediction.

AB  - Persistent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a prerequisite for cervical cancer development. Few studies investigated clearance of high-risk HPV in low-and-middle-income countries. Our study investigated HPV clearance and persistence over four years in women from North Tongu District, Ghana. In 2010/2011, cervical swabs of 500 patients were collected and HPV genotyped (nested multiplex PCR) in Accra, Ghana. In 2014, 104 women who previously tested positive for high-risk HPV and remained untreated were re-tested for HPV. Cytobrush samples were genotyped (GP5+/6+ PCR & Luminex-MPG readout) in Berlin, Germany. Positively tested patients underwent colposcopy and treatment if indicated. Of 104 women, who tested high-risk HPV+ in 2010/2011, seven (6,7%; 95%CI: 2.7-13.4%) had >=1 persistent high-risk-infection after ~4 years (mean age 39 years). Ninety-seven (93,3%; 95%CI: 86.6-97.3%) had cleared the original infection, while 22 (21.2%; 95%CI: 13.8-30.3%) had acquired new high-risk infections with other genotypes. Persistent types found were HPV 16, 18, 35, 39, 51, 52, 58, and 68. Among those patients, one case of CIN2 (HPV 68) and one micro-invasive cervical cancer (HPV 16) were detected. This longitudinal observational data suggest that single HPV screening rounds may lead to over-referral. Including type-specific HPV re-testing or additional triage methods could help reduce follow-up rates.Copyright © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing is more sensitive than cytology for the detection of cervical cancer and its precursors. However, limited and inconsistent data are available about the efficacy of the combination of these two methods for screening cervical adenocarcinoma. This multicenter retrospective study investigated the screening results of a cohort of Chinese patients who were subsequently diagnosed with invasive cervical adenocarcinoma, with the goal of identifying the optimal cervical adenocarcinoma screening method. Method(s): We retrospectively retrieved and analyzed the data from patients with histologically confirmed primary invasive cervical adenocarcinoma from eight local pathology laboratories operated by KingMed Diagnostics, the largest independent operator of pathology laboratories in China, over a 2-year period. Only patients who underwent cytology and/or HR-HPV testing within 6 months before the adenocarcinoma diagnosis were included. HR-HPV DNA was detected using one of two HPV test kits: the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and an HPV genotyping panel (Yaneng Bio, Shenzhen, China). Result(s): Of the 311 patients, 136 underwent cytology alone, 106 underwent HR-HPV testing alone, and 69 underwent cytology and HR-HPV co-testing. The sensitivities of cytology alone (64.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.9-72.0) and HR-HPV testing alone (66.0, 95% CI: 57.0-75.1) were similar (P = 0.738). The sensitivity of cytology and HR-HPV co-testing (87.0, 95% CI: 79.0-94.9) was significantly higher than that of either cytology (P = 0.001) or HR-HPV testing alone (P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): Both cytology alone and HR-HPV testing alone showed poor screening efficiency, whereas the combination of the two clearly increased the efficiency of primary cervical adenocarcinoma screening. Thus, cytology and HR-HPV co-testing might be the most efficient cervical adenocarcinoma screening method.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is caused by a persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV). Therefore, tests which detect the carcinogenic virus can be used for cervical cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: This is the first evaluation of the HPV DNA Array (AID Diagnostika, Strassberg, Germany), an E1-based genotyping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for identification of 29 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73, 82, 85, and 97). METHODS: Analytical performance of the assay was assessed with cervical cancer cell lines with known HPV status, and preselected clinical cervical scrapings genotyped by multiplexed genotyping (MPG) with a Luminex readout (validated in-house assay). Intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility experiments were performed to ensure the reliability of the assay. RESULTS: HPV DNA Array identified the intrinsic HPV genotype in all cervical cancer cell lines and demonstrated a high sensitivity for HPV16 probe (1 cell per PCR reaction), as well as HPV18 and 45 probes (100 cells per PCR reaction). When compared with MPG, HPV DNA Array showed a good agreement of 92.2% for HPV detection irrespective of type (kappa = 0.601), and demonstrated high agreement for HPV16 (80.7%, kappa = 0.836) and HPV18 (86.7%, kappa = 0.925). Furthermore, high intra-/inter-laboratory reproducibility was observed (90.9-100%). CONCLUSION: HPV DNA Array showed high sensitivity for correct HPV genotype detection in experimental and clinical samples with a good correlation to the reference test. Since HPV DNA Array is based on a simple multiplexed PCR followed by reverse hybridization in a 96-well format and automated visual readout by AID ELISpot reader, it is capable of high throughput in a time-effective manner. HPV DNA Array could be considered for extended HPV genotyping of cervical smears.

AB  - Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and human papillomavirus (HPV) has been increasingly recognized as a pathogenic factor for the initiation and development of HNSCC. E6 oncogene, an essential component of the HPV 16 virus, acts as a leading cause of the malignant transformation of cancer cells. Therefore, investigating the biological effect and potential mechanisms of E6 oncogene on HNSCC cells and exploring potential therapeutic methods is of great value. Method(s): MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis assay were implemented to detect the biological effect of E6 oncogene on the growth of HNSCC cells. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were used to evaluate the role of E6 in the migration and invasion of HNSCC cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay were adopted to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying E6-induced HNSCC progression. Then, exogenous secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was added into the cell culture to investigate whether it could maintain its tumor suppressor effect on E6-expressing HNSCC cells. Result(s): HPV E6 oncogene could promote the proliferation, cell cycle period, apoptosis resistance, migration and invasion of HNSCC cells by activating NF-kappaB and Akt pathways. Immunohistochemical analysis conducted on HNSCC tissues illustrated that SLPI was further downregulated in HPV positive HNSCC compared to HNSCC without HPV infection. Exogenous SLPI significantly inhibited HPV E6-mediated malignant phenotypes in HNSCC cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB and Akt and signaling pathways. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that E6 oncogene led to the malignant transformation of HNSCC cells by regulating multiple pathways. SLPI could reverse the effect of E6 oncogene on HNSCC, implying that the functional inhibition of E6 by SLPI may be exploited as an attractive therapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Aims Annual opportunistic screening for cervical carcinoma has been done in Germany since 1971. The creation of this S3 guideline meets an important need, outlined in the National Cancer Plan, with regard to screening for cervical cancer, as this guideline aims to provide important information and support for planned organized screening for cervical cancer in Germany. Methods With the financial support of German Cancer Aid, 21 professional societies developed evidence-based statements and recommendations (classified using the GRADE system) for the screening, management and treatment of precancerous conditions of the cervix. Two independent scientific institutes compiled systematic reviews for this guideline. Recommendations The second part of this short summary deals with the triage, treatment and follow-up care of cervical dysplasia. With regard to those women who do not participate in screening, the guideline authors recommend sending out repeat invitation letters or an HPV self-collection kit. Colposcopy should be carried out for further investigation if cytology findings are Pap II-p and HPV test results are positive or if the results of an HPV 16 or HPV 18 screening test are positive. A single abnormal Pap smear should be triaged and investigated using HPV testing or p16/Ki67 dual staining.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Introduction/Background Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection is a sensitive technique for cervical cancer screening but its specificity remains limited. New molecular tests are available, easy to use. In our study we used The OncoE6 test to detect E6 Oncoprotein from cervical specimens. The aim is to establish the HPV genotype profil in cervical cancer patients in Casablanca, and compare the results of genotyping with the OncoE6 test results. So we can determin the feasibility of a screening with the new HPV generation test in Morocco. Methodology It's cross-sectional study that was conducted at Mohammed VI Center for Cancer treatment. The study included patients newly diagnosed with cervical cancer. Patients who received previous treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) were excluded. Two samples were taken from the cervix for each patient, One sent to Berlin for multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) genotyping, second samples were analyzed in Casablanca by a different investigator, using the OncoE6 test. Results Thirty patients were included in our study. The average age was 58,65+/-11,83. The histopathological examination showed Squamous Cell Carcinoma in 80% of the cases and Adenocarcinoma in 20%. The OncoE6 test was positive in the two thirds of cases. 42% of the cases tested positive to the Oncoprotein E6 HPV 16 type, and 23% were positive to the OncoE6 HPV 18 type. Genotyping revealed the presence of 12 serotypes of High Risk HPV, the most frequent was HPV 16. In 7 cases there was more than one serotype. For the patients who tested negative to the OncoE6 test, the genotyping identified 8 different high risk HPV apart from HPV 16 and 18. Conclusion High risk HPV serotypes found in our patients apart from 16 and 18 suggest that the test must be adapted to our context before using it for screening.

AB  - Objectives: In Germany, cervical cancer screening is moving from opportunistic annual Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology for women as of age 20 years to organized screening with 3-yearly co-testing using human papillomavirus testing (HPV) and Pap cytology for women as of age 35 years and annual Pap for women age 20-34 years. Our aim was to systematically evaluate the impact of the new cervical cancer screening policy on long-term benefits and harms. Method(s): A Markov-state-transition model calibrated to the German epidemiological and clinical context of the disease was used to evaluate different screening strategies that differ by primary screening test (Pap cytology, HPV-testing), screening interval, age, and specific follow-up algorithms. German clinical and epidemiological data, and test accuracy data from international meta-analyses were incorporated. Predicted outcomes were reduction in cervical cancer incidence, and -mortality, total cases of positive test results, colposcopies, and conizations. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed. For organized screening, 50-70% adherence rates were assumed. Result(s): Compared with current opportunistic annual Pap screening the new screening policy including organized screening with 3-yearly HPV-Pap co-testing as of age 35 years and annual Pap for younger women would result in similar or greater benefits in terms of reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The model predicted substantial relative risk reductions (RRR) in total positive test results (RRR: 22%), total cases of colposcopies (RRR: 44%), and conizations (RRR: 8%) compared with organized annual Pap screening. Risk-adapted screening with increased intervals for women vaccinated against oncogenic HPV types would additionally reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Conclusion(s): Based on our benefit-harm analysis, the new German screening policy for cervical cancer screening including HPV-Pap co-testing in women as of age 35 years reduces overtreatment, likely without loss in benefits. Risk-adapted screening strategies based on women's screening history and vaccination status should be considered in future policy adaptations.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Introduction: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an etiological risk factor for a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. HPV has been proven to be a powerful prognostic biomarker for oropharyngeal cancer, but its role in the larynx has not been explored in depth. Here, we sought to evaluate the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) in Egyptian population Patients and Methods: In Mansoura University Hospitals; HPV DNA in specimens from 30 patients diagnosed with LSCC and 20 patients with benign non neoplastic laryngeal lesions were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, and p16 overexpression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Due to variations in p16-INK4a immunostaining outcome, the German semi-quantitative scoring system was applied. The result was calculated by multiplying the scores of intensity by the scores of percentage areas of stained cell; with the minimum score is zero and the maximum is 12. The score of four or higher is considered positive. Result(s): Among LSCC patients, 13 (43.3%) were positive for HPV DNA (HPV+), while all of the benign laryngeal lesions were HPV- and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). The HPV+ cases included 7 cases of genotype HPV16 and 6 cases of HPV18. p16 expression was observed in 8 of 13 (61.5%) cases previously determined to be HPV DNA positive (n = 3 for genotype 16; n = 5 for genotype 18). All benign laryngeal lesions were negative for p16 expression. Conclusion(s): Our findings support a possible role of HPV in laryngeal carcinogenesis. This study indicates that HPV DNA is a more reliable surrogate marker than p16 for the prediction of outcomes in patients with LSCC.

AB  - Purpose or Objective To estimate the incidence and prevalence of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck (SCCHN) in the United States, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and Japan over the next ten years using a multi-factorial forecast model. Material and Methods SCCHN is a diffused clinical entity comprising multiple tumor sites in the head and neck region. We classify these sites by anatomical location, these are: * Larynx * Nasopharynx * Oral cavity * Oropharynx * Hypopharynx * Other SCCHN (pharynx unspecified, waldeyer ring, overlapping lesion of lip, oral cavity and pharynx, nasal cavity, middle ear and accessory sinuses). Using a critically appraised set of country-specific cancer registries, SCCHN incidence was estimated for the baseline year, which was the latest year of available data in each registry. These baseline estimates were trended over the next ten years using a risk-factor based forecast model. Smoking is an established risk factor for SCCHN; we incorporated effect of smoking on the risk of SCCHN for all tumor sites except oropharynx. Based on the published literature, oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma incidence is increasing historically, unlike other tumor sites, and this increase is mainly attributable to oral Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection. Thus, we incorporated effect of oral HPV infection to trend the risk of oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma. Prevalence was estimated as a cumulative incidence over preceding twenty years with adjustments for disease-specific and competing-cause mortality for each year. The incident population for all tumor sites except other SCCHN was stratified by HPV status. The incident Nasopharynx population was also stratified by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV status) in all countries except Japan. Result(s): The incidence of SCCHN is 17 cases per 100,000/year, resulting in 135,000 new cases in 2018. This will increase to 19 cases per 100,000/year in 2028, resulting in 148,000 new cases. The prevalence of SCCHN is 155 cases per 100,000 and 1.2 million people are living with SCCHN in 2018. This will increase to 178 cases per 100,000 and 1.4 million people living with SCCHN in 2028. Nearly 30% of SCCHN incident cases are HPV positive. Nearly 65% of nasopharynx squamous cell carcinoma incident cases are EBV positive. [Figure Presented] Conclusion The incidence and prevalence of SCCHN is expected to increase over the next ten years. Population aging, changes in population size, and improvements in survival will drive this increase, despite overall reductions in the age-specific risk of SCCHN across the countries under study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in breast cancer (BC) tissues has been widely investigated in recent years. HPV DNA has been detected in ductal lavage fluids and in serum-derived extracellular vesicles of patients with benign or in situ breast lesions. However, there are no data attesting to its presence in liquid biopsies of different BC subtypes or to its impact on prognosis. Methods We analyzed a total of 72 serum samples for the presence of circulating HPV DNA, of which 20 were from luminal A BC (5 relapsed, 15 non relapsed), 17 from luminal B BC (5 relapsed, 12 non relapsed), 15 from triple-negative BC (6 relapsed and 9 non relapsed), 12 from HER2-positive BC (3 relapsed, 9 non relapsed) and 8 from healthy subjects. Circulating DNA was extracted and purified from 500 mul of serum by Qiamp DNA minikit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HPV DNA was assessed by a high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based method (Mass Array Platform, Agena Bioscience, Hamburg, Germany). The DNA target sequence was amplified by a multiplex PCR with HPV E6 or E7 gene-specific primers. A primer for primer extension annealing to the amplified product was extended at its 3' terminal base for each HPV type. Results HPV DNA was detected in 5 BC patients but in none of the healthy controls. None of the serum samples analyzed showed HPV DNA types 16 or 18. Four of the 5 BC cases had high-risk HPV DNA (type 39,45,52,59) and one had low-risk HPV DNA (type 73). The 4 patients with high risk HPV DNA had low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) detected by Pap smear prior to the diagnosis of BC. No relation was found between HPV infection and tumor subtype or prognosis. Our in vitro studies also revealed the active release of HPV DNA into the extracellular vesicle compartment of cervical cancer cells. Table 1. View inline Features of BC patients positive for circulating HPV DNA. Conclusions Our findings support the feasibility of HPV DNA evaluation by liquid biopsy in BC. They also suggest that circulating HPV DNA in BC patients might be of cervical tissue origin and that the presence of HPV DNA in BC may be a consequence of its spreading from virus-infected tissue such as that of the uterine cervix.

AB  - Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus with more than 100 genotypes, at least 12 of which are high-risk and associated with high-grade cervical lesions. Data on the prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes among women are not yet available for the total regions of Iran. Objective(s): The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of high-risk HPV types among women screened for cervical carci-noma in Yazd and compare the cytology, histology, and colposcopy results. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, 402 women referring to gynecology clinics of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sci-ences, Yazd, Iran, were selected. The Pap smear and HPV typing were performed on cervical samples. The high-risk HPV types were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based reverse blot hybridization assay. Colposcopy was carried out on patients with high-risk HPV types, and biopsies were taken for histological examination. Result(s): Among 402 women screened by HPV-PCR, 32 (7.97%) women were positive for high-risk HPV types. Human papillomavirus 16 and HPV18 were the most frequent genotypes (46.9%). The cytology, histology, and colposcopy results were abnormal in 56.2%, 29.1%, and 71.9% of patients, respectively. Pap smear had 100% sensitivity and 58.3% specificity for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions, while these values for colposcopy were 75% and 87.5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The frequency of high-risk HPV types was relatively low among women living in Yazd than in those from other provinces of Iran. A significant percentage of patients with HPV had normal cervical cytology and histology. Therefore, HPV typing is recommended to decrease the development of cervical cancer. Colposcopy had acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).

AB  -: BVAC-C is a B cell-based and monocyte-based immuno-therapeutic vaccine transfected with a recombinant human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 E6/E7 gene and loaded with alpha-galactosyl ceramide, which is a natural killer T cell ligand. This phase I study sought to determine the tolerability and immunogenicity of BVAC-C in platinum-resistant recurrent cervical cancer patients. Patients with HPV 16-positive or 18-positive recurrent or persistent cervical cancer who had received at least one prior platinum-based combination chemotherapy were enrolled. BVAC-C was injected intravenously three times every four weeks, and dose escalation was planned in a three-patient cohort design at doses of 1 x 10(7), 4 x 10(7), or 1 x 10(8) cells/dose. Eleven patients were enrolled, and six (55%) patients had received two or more lines of platinum-based chemotherapy prior to enrollment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 21 cycles. Most TRAEs were mild fever (n = 6, 55%) or myalgia (n = 4, 36%). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. The overall response rate was 11% among nine patients evaluable, and the duration of response was 10 months. Five patients (56%) achieved a stable disease for 4.2-11 months as their best overall response. The median progression-free survival in all patients was 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.2 to infinite months), and the overall survival rate at 6 and 12 months was 89% (95% CI, 71 to 100%) and 65% (95% CI, 39 to 100%), respectively. BVAC-C induced the activation of natural killer T cells, natural killer cells, and HPV 16/18 E6/E7-specific T cells upon vaccination in all patients evaluated. BVAC-C was well tolerated and demonstrated a durable anti-tumor activity with an immune response in HPV 16-positive or 18-positive recurrent cervical carcinoma patients. A Phase 2 efficacy trial is currently underway.

AB  - Background: WHO is developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100 000 women and includes 2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed the impact of achieving the 90-70-90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030. Method(s): The WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three independent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) were estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10-14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only vaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and to scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage by 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which would increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions. Finding(s): In 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was 13.2 (range 12.9-14.1) per 100 000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0.1% (0.1-0.5) reduction, but additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34.2% (23.3-37.8), averting 300 000 (300 000-400 000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening). By 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61.7% (61.4-66.1), averting 4.8 million (4.1-4.8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 88.9% (84.0-89.3), averting 13.3 million (13.1-13.6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92.3% (88.4-93.0), averting 14.6 million (14.1-14.6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 89.5% (86.6-89.9), averting 45.8 million (44.7-46.4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97.9% (95.0-98.0), averting 60.8 million (60.2-61.2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 98.6% (96.5-98.6), averting 62.6 million (62.1-62.8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45-55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29-34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions. For premature deaths (age 30-69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33.9% (24.4-37.9) by 2030, 96.2% (94.3-96.8) by 2070, and 98.6% (96.9-98.8) by 2120. Interpretation(s): These findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a one-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation of the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.

AB  - Recent reports have pointed to the link between persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, and carcinogenesis; however most of the studies concerning the role of viruses in head and neck cancer (HNC) are focused mainly on one type of virus. Our present study aimed to study the relationship between Epstein-Barr virus/human papilloma virus (EBV/HPV) coinfection and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in oropharyngeal cancer. Fresh-frozen tumor tissue samples were collected from 128 patients with oropharyngeal cancer infected with EBV or HPV or with EBV/HPV coinfection. After DNA extraction, EBV and HPV DNA was detected using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. GPx and SOD activity was determined in homogenates of cancer tissue using diagnostic kits produced by Randox Laboratories. Both GPx and SOD activity was statistically lower in patients with EBV/HPV coinfection than in a single EBV or HPV infection. Analysis of GPx and SOD activity in relation to histological grading and tumor, node (TN) classification revealed that in poorly-differentiated tumors, the level of antioxidant enzymes was lower compared with well-differentiated lesions and in cases with greater tumor dimensions and lymph-node involvement, both GPx and SOD activity was decreased. Further studies are necessary to clarify the influence of interplay between EBV, HPV, and oxidative stress on malignant transformation of upper aerodigestive tract epithelial cells.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been widely used for the discovery of novel human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, variant characterization and genotyping. Here, we compared the analytical performance of NGS with a commercial PCR-based assay (Anyplex II HPV28) in cervical samples of 744 women. Overall, HPV positivity was 50.2% by the Anyplex and 45.5% by the NGS. With the NGS, we detected 25 genotypes covered by Anyplex and 41 additional genotypes. Agreement between the two methods for HPV positivity was 80.8% (kappa = 0.616) and 84.8% (kappa = 0.652) for 28 HPV genotypes and 14 high-risk genotypes, respectively. We recovered and characterized 243 complete HPV genomes from 153 samples spanning 40 different genotypes. According to phylogenetic analysis and pairwise distance, we identified novel lineages and sublineages of four high-risk and 16 low-risk genotypes. In total, 17 novel lineages and 14 novel sublineages were proposed, including novel lineages of HPV45, HPV52, HPV66 and a novel sublineage of HPV59. Our study provides important genomic insights on HPV types and lineages, where few complete genomes were publicly available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the rate of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes in vaccinated (Gardasil [quadrivalent]) and unvaccinated cohorts of young women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study, consisting of the comparison of the prevalence of HPV 16, 18, and other HR genotypes in 2183 women younger than 25 years, according to their birth year (born >1994 [mostly vaccinated <13 years]; born 1992-1994 [vaccinated at 17 years]; born <1992 [not vaccinated/vaccinated >17 years]), in a private laboratory. RESULTS: The rates of HPV 16, 18, 16/18, and others in the cohort born before 1992 (n = 331) were 6.3%, 1.5%, 7.9%, and 31.7%. In those born 1992-1994 (n = 901), the rates were 3.3%, 0.4%, 3.6%, and 32.5%; in the ones born after 1994 (n = 951), the rates were 0.7%, 0.2%, 0.9%, and 33.2%, respectively.There were no changes in the relative risk (RR) of HR-HPV infection by genotypes other than HPV 16/18 in any cohort.The RR was significantly reduced in the cohort born after 1994 for HPV 16 (0.12 [0.050-0.270], p < .0001), HPV 18 (0.14 [0.027-0.714], p = .02), and HPV 16/18 (0.12 [0.057-0.254], p < .0001).In those born 1992-1994, there was a nearly significant reduction in the RR of HPV 18 infection (0.29 [0.079-1.09], p = .07); the reduction was significant for HPV 16 (0.52 [0.305-0.904], p = .02) and HPV 16/18 (0.45 [0.274-0.747], p = .0018). CONCLUSIONS: Young women vaccinated before 13 years had a nearly 90% risk reduction of HPV 16/18, whereas if vaccinated at 17 years, the decrease was of 50%. There was no impact in the nonvaccine genotypes.Our data highlight the importance of vaccinating at young age and of introducing vaccines covering more HR genotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the clinical activity and safety of bintrafusp alfa, a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)RII receptor (a TGF-beta 'trap') fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody blocking programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), in patients with heavily pretreated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). METHODS: In this phase I dose-expansion cohort, patients with advanced SCCHN not amenable to curative therapy that progressed/recurred after platinum therapy in the recurrent/metastatic setting, or <6 months after platinum therapy in the locally advanced setting, received bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed best overall response (BOR; Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1) per independent review committee (IRC); other endpoints included BOR per investigator and safety. RESULTS: As of August 24, 2018, 32 patients had received bintrafusp alfa (median follow-up 86.4 weeks; range 2-97). Per IRC, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 13% (95% CI 4% to 29%; 4 partial responses (PR)); 4 patients had stable disease (SD) (disease control rate 34%; 95% CI 12% to 43%). Per investigator, there were 5 PRs (ORR, 16%), including 2 patients who developed delayed PRs after initial disease increase (total clinical response rate 22%). Responses (ORRs) were observed in patients with PD-L1-positive (12%), PD-L1-negative (17%; 73-10 antibody for immunohistochemistry), human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive (33%) and HPV-negative tumors (5%). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 11 patients (34%), with no grade 4 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Bintrafusp alfa showed clinical activity across subgroups of PD-L1 expression and in HPV-positive tumors and had a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated advanced SCCHN. Activity in HPV-positive tumors is favorable compared with historical data from PD-L1 inhibitors and is being further investigated in an ongoing study of HPV-associated tumors.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the fourth most common cause of cervical cancer (CC). The aim of the present study was to investigate gene expression levels of previously identified transcriptional signatures for malignant and non-malignant CC. Material(s) and Method(s): To validate of previously analyzed microarray gene expression data, we selected two hub genes (CDK1 and PLK1) and four differentially expressed mRNAs that were common in pre-malignant-normal and malig-nant-pre-malignant networks (SMS, NNT, UHMK1 and DEPDC1). To this purpose, the study included women diagnosed histologically with malignant CC (n=15), pre-malignant (n=15), and normal subjects (n=15). The expression of six host genes and viral E6/E7 genes were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. Result(s): The results showed higher expression of CDK1/PLK1 hub genes and SMS, NNT and UHMK1 genes in malignant CC group than non-malignant CC group and normal group. A positive correlation was observed between gene expression of viral E6/E7 oncogenes and UHMK1 gene. Conclusion(s): Dysregulation of several mRNA signatures are a common feature of CC and can be potentially used as diagnos-tic and prognostic biomarkers as well as can be applied to therapeutic targets for CC treatment.Copyright © 2020, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most frequent tumors of skin and muco-cutaneous junctions in the horse. Equine papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV2) has been detected in equine SCC of the oral tract and genitals, and recently also in the larynx. As human squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (SCCL), it is strongly etiologically associated with high-risk papillomavirus (h-HPV) infection. This study focuses on tumor cells behavior in a naturally occurring tumor that can undergo the so-called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). A SCCL in a horse was investigated by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against E-cadherin, pan-cytokeratin AE3/AE1, beta-catenin, N-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB-1, TWIST, and HIF-1alpha. EcPV2 DNA detection and expression of oncogenes in SCC were investigated. A cadherin switch and an intermediate filaments rearrangement within primary site tumor cells together with the expression of the EMT-related transcription factors TWIST-1, ZEB-1, and HIF-1alpha were observed. DNA obtained from the tumor showed EcPV2 positivity, with E2 gene disruption and E6 gene dysregulation. The results suggest that equine SCCL might be a valuable model for studying EMT and the potential interactions between EcPV2 oncoproteins and the EMT process in SCCL.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The new guideline on organized cancer screening programs has been in force in Germany since January 1st, 2020. The guideline has amended earlier recommendations on cytological examinations, which were previously carried out annually during screening. The guidelines-based recommendations on the appropriate follow-up for preinvasive and invasive lesions of the uterine cervix and endometrium are briefly outlined and differentiated from screening cytology and Pap/HPV co-testing as described in the guideline on organized cancer screening programs (oKFE-RL).Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are the most common sexually transmitted viral diseases. Prophylactic measures such as HPV vaccination and behavioural precautions for genital herpes are the most promising strategies to prevent these viral infections. The HPV vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of HPV-associated tumors, but the vaccination rate is far too low in Germany. Cervical cancer is comparatively rare in Germany today and the incidence rate of new cases has been stagnating at a low level for years. Since a persistent hrHPV infection is necessary for the development of cervical cancer, the cervical cancer screening program was modified in January 2020. For women aged 35 years and older, an HPV cervical smear test is now performed in addition to cytology and the screening interval has been extended to three years. The test algorithm for younger women has not been changed. For genital HSV infections, aciclovir-based therapy regimens are recommended, prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines will not be available in the near future. Therefore, information of the patient about the specifics of the disease (such as the often asymptomatic virus shedding) and initiation of an appropriate therapy are decisive for the reduction of the HSV transmission risk and for the treatment success.Copyright © 2020 Mediengruppe Oberfranken - Fachverlage GmbH & Co.

AB  - Researches on detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) high-risk samples were carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with microchip electrophoresis (MCE). Herein, we introduced a simple, rapid, automated method for detecting high-risk samples HPV16 and HPV18. In this research, general primers were initially selected to obtain sufficient detectable yield by PCR to verify feasibility of MCM method for HPV detection, then type-specific primers were further used to evaluate the specificity of MCE method. The results indicated MCE method was capable of specifically detecting high-risk HPV16 and HPV18, and also enabled simultaneous detection of multiplex samples. This MCE method described here has been successfully applied to HPV detection and displayed excellent reliability demonstrating by sequencing results. The inherent capability of MCE facilitated HPV detection conducted in a small chip with automated, high throughput, massive parallelized analysis. We envision that MCE method will definitely pave a way for clinical diagnosis, and even on-site screening of cervical cancer.Copyright © 2020 Xi'an Jiaotong University

AB  - Purpose: The PODCAD study aimed at assessing the degree of psychological stress that women experience due to notification of an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear finding or a positive human papillomavirus (HPV) test result. Method(s): We designed a survey to address the question of psychological burden due to abnormal Pap smear results and/or positive HPV tests. In this online campaign approach, we aimed to reach > 2000 women all over Germany irrespective of kind and number of abnormal screening findings. We asked for different kinds of anxiety, distress and uncertainty regarding both, Pap and HPV status. Result(s): A total of 3753 women completed the survey at least partially, and almost 2300 fully completed the survey. Of these, more than 50% were affected already since more than 1 year, and almost half of them had experienced at least three Pap smears in follow-up examinations. Almost 70% of the women were afraid of developing cancer. Intriguingly, almost half of the women with abnormal findings were not aware of their stage of the Pap smear. Furthermore, almost 30% of the women displayed signs of a post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion(s): Abnormal results in cervical cancer screening have an impact on patients' psychology, irrespective of the knowledge and severity of the findings. Better information concerning risks and benefits of cervical cancer screening and about the meaning of the outcome of its procedures are required to decrease this anxiety.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the past three decades, the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has increased, primarily related to the spread of human papillomavirus. Treatment has always been preferentially unimodal (surgery or radiotherapy) for early stage disease and multimodal (surgery with adjuvant therapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy) for advanced stages. Recently, the surgical approach has gained renewed interest due to the morbidity of non-surgical treatments and also to technical innovations. We have coined the term 3Des (3D exoscope surgery) to describe the use of the 3D Vitom Exoscope System for transoral surgery of oropharyngeal cancers. During the period from June 2017 to May 2018, 10 patients with oropharyngeal cancer were treated by oropharyngeal surgery with the 3Des approach at FPO IRCCS Institute of Candiolo. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the utility of 3Des for the treatment of early-stage oropharyngeal cancer. 3Des could represent a viable alternative to the operating microscope and robotic surgery thanks to its excellent ability to provide 3D visual information, depth of field, magnification, image contrast, color imaging, and low running costs. It promises great utility in the learning process, with the possibility of recording in high definition.© Copyright © 2020 Crosetti, Arrigoni, Manca, Caracciolo, Bertotto and Succo.

AB  - This article compares the expression and applicability of biomarkers, from single genes and gene signatures, identified in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using the GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0, nCounter, and real-time PCR analyses. Two multicenter, retrospective cohorts of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group who received postoperative radiochemotherapy or primary radiochemotherapy were considered. Real-time PCR was performed for a limited number of 38 genes of the cohort who received postoperative radiochemotherapy only. Correlations between the methods were evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Patients were stratified based on the expression of putative cancer stem cell markers, hypoxia-associated gene signatures, and a previously developed seven-gene signature. Locoregional tumor control was compared between these patient subgroups using log-rank tests. Gene expressions obtained from nCounter analyses were moderately correlated to GeneChip analyses (median rho = approximately 0.68). A higher correlation was obtained between nCounter analyses and real-time PCR (median rho = 0.84). Significant associations with locoregional tumor control were observed for most of the considered biomarkers evaluated by GeneChip and nCounter analyses. In general, all applied biomarkers (single genes and gene signatures) classified approximately 70% to 85% of the patients similarly. Overall, gene signatures seem to be more robust and had a better transferability among different measurement methods.Copyright © 2020 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology

AB  - Background In Brazil, penile cancer (PC) is not uncommon. The highest incidence of PC is in the North and Northeast of the country. In addition to phimosis, the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Baar Virus (EBV) infections are also related as risk factors for PC. The overexpression of p16INK4a is a surrogate sensitive marker of HPV infection in PC. Objectives To correlate p16INK4a overexpression and HPV infection status with EBV infection in a series of PC patients from the Amazon region. Methods Tumor tissues from 47 PC cases were analyzed for the presence of HPV and EBV DNA by PCR. All PC patients were diagnosed between 2013 and 2018 at a public reference cancer center hospital in Manaus, Amazonas-Brazil. HPV was genotyped using E7 HPV16/ HPV18 type-specific real-time PCR and the PapilloCheck HPV-Screening assay. p16INK4a expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the automated Ventana BenchMark Ultra. Results The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 57.4 years +/-SD 17.8 ranging from 20 to 90 years old. Most of the patients (64%) came from rural areas of the Amazonas State. Thirty patients had phimosis (64%). Among the patients with phimosis, 43% (13/30) underwent circumcision, three during childhood and 10 in adulthood. 60% of the patients were smokers or ex-smokers. HPV infection was observed in 45% (21/47) of cases. HPV16 was detected in 13 patients (61%). Other HPV types detected were HPV 6, 11, 42, 51, 53, 68 and 44/55. EBV infection was observed in 30% (14/47) of the patients with PC. Co-infection with HPV and EBV was observed in 28% (6/21) cases. p16INK4a was only investigated in 26 samples. The p16INK4a overexpression was observed exclusively in HPV 16 positive cases and four HPV negative cases. In the survival analysis, the follow-up time was 35.4 months/ patient. The mortality rate during the follow up time was 38%. Conclusions p16INK4a positivity presented a high correlation to HPV 16 DNA detection, reinforcing its use as a surrogate marker for HPV-driven cancers. Infection with EBV was quite frequent and its role in epithelial penile oncogenesis needs to be demonstrated.Copyright © 2020 Martins et al.

AB  - Background: In accordance with the decision of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA), early screening for cervical cancer will be a part of an organized cancer screening program with an invitation model starting in 2020. This offers the opportunity for more socially balanced participation. Material(s) and Method(s): The relevant literature was evaluated. Result(s): Starting in 2020, the cervical cancer screening program provides that health insurance companies invite eligible women between the ages of 20 and 65 to be examined every 5 years. Eligible women can also go to the screening without an invitation. There is no age limit for screening for cervical cancer. In women who are 20-34 years old, an annual cytological examination (Pap smear) is performed as before. As of January 1, 2020, a new feature is that women aged 35 and over are entitled to a combined screening of cytological examination and HPV (human papillomavirus) test every 3 years (co-test). The HPV test enables better detection of CIN 3 (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) compared to cytology, so that the screening interval has been extended from annually to triennially. According to the guideline for organized cancer screening programs, the co-test can be repeated or a clarification colposcopy can be carried out in case of abnormal findings. This new service includes, among other things, an examination with a colposcope, if necessary, a biopsy and a curettage, and the advice to the insured. Conclusion(s): Based on the evidence accumulated and evaluated in the S3 guideline for the prevention of cervical cancer, cancer prevention in Germany has been developed further. These changes include a double paradigm shift in secondary prevention with the introduction of molecular detection of HPV and organized screening.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal is a rare malignancy. Yet, the incidence of anal cancer continues to rise in Germany. More than 80% of all anal cancers are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There are few prospective studies on the choice of chemotherapy in the metastatic situation. Chemotherapy is the classic systemic treatment. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors is currently being evaluated in clinical studies. Aim(s): An overview of the current studies for the systemic treatment of metastasized anal carcinoma is provided. Material(s) and Method(s): For this purpose, a literature search was conducted to find evidence for systemic therapeutic options for metastatic anal carcinoma. Result(s): Paclitaxel plus carboplatin or the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin can be given as first-line chemotherapy. Second-line chemotherapy has not been tested in trials to date, but may be given with a taxane or a 5-FU-based regime, depending on the initial use. Immunotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab is included as a second-line treatment. Conclusion The association of HPV with anal carcinoma is gaining importance for future immunotherapeutic approaches. In addition, a multimodal therapy concept seems to have a high relevance for the prognosis of patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - This study is to evaluate the screening methods of cervical cancers for rural females in Kash bachu, Xinjiang, China.A total number of 3000 married females were surveyed, and subjected to the gynecological examination. In these subjects, 1993 females received the careHPV (human papillomavirus) test, while 1007 females underwent the visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI). The subjects positive for careHPV detection were subjected to Cervista, Cobas 4800, and Aptima HPV detection, and Thinprep Cytologic Test (TCT). The subjects positive for 1 detection only received colposcopy cervical biopsy.A total of 569 subjects received the cervical biopsy, and the positive rate was 2.3% (69/3000), while the detection rate for CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) II and above levels was 1.13% (34/3000). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that, the area under the curve (AUC) value for the careHPV test was 0.671, which was higher than the VIA/VILI (0.619), suggesting higher diagnostic value for the careHPV test. For the Cervista, Cobas 4800, Aptima HPV detection, and TCT methods, the highest AUC value was observed for the TCT method, indicating that the TCT method is the most valuable for the cervical cancer screening.The diagnostic value of careHPV test is superior to the VIA/VILA detection method. The TCT method has the greatest value for the cervical cancer screening. The Cervista HPV detection method should be considered where the conditions are limited.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - PURPOSE: The current cervical cancer screening program in Germany recommends that the results showing suspected HPV infection should be further examined in specialized colposcopy units. This study aimed to correlate externally documented Pap smear results with in-house colposcopy-guided Pap cytology results and compare colposcopy-guided biopsy and postoperative histopathology results. METHODS: Clinical data were analyzed from 3627 examinations in 2844 patients who visited a university certified dysplasia unit from 2014 to 2017; 2212 patients underwent complete assessments, including Pap smear, colposcopy, HPV testing, colposcopy-guided biopsy, and/or surgery. The results were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: External and in-house Pap results were consistent in 1054 ofthe 2212 patients (47.65%). Referral cytology showed a higher grade than in-house in 456 (20.61%) and a lower grade in 702 (31.74%). Using the histopathological findings as the gold standard, overdiagnosis in the referral cytology was noted in 180 patients (13.19%), underdiagnosis in 263 (19.27%), and concordant findings in 922 (67.55%). For in-house cytology, overdiagnosis was found in 133 patients (10.74%), underdiagnosis in 192 (15.51%), and accurate diagnosis with congruent cytology and histopathology findings in 913 (73.75%). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of detection of cervical abnormalities differs significantly depending on whether the examination is performed routinely or in specialized units. Colposcopy-guided Pap smears correlate significantly better with histology than referral cytology results without colposcopic guidance. More severe lesions were also detected more accurately.

AB  - Introduction In a functional immune system HLA-molecules are able to present antigens to immune cells. Because of peptide restriction in HLA-class I-molecules, antigen presentation is depending on the individual HLA-allele composition. Therefore, antitumor immunity and tumor development are, among other factors, also dependent on the patient's HLAgenotype. The Aim of this study was to analyse the different HLA-allele frequencies between HNSCC patients and a healthy control and between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC patients, respectively. Material and Methods Hiqh resolution sequencing was performed on 150 HNSCC patients. The HLA-frequencies of the control group were taken from a public accessible HLA-database which included HLA data from 39639 German patients. To analyse the different HLA-allel frequencies between the mentioned groups, qui square test and with frequencies under 5 exact fisher test was performed. Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli was used to correct for multiple testing. Results Our data showed significant increased frequencies of HLA-A*66:01 in HNSCC patients in comparison to the control group. Furthermore the analysis of the HLA alleles dependent on the HPV status showed a significant increase of HLADRB1z.ast;04:01 in HPV-positive HNSCC and HLA-B z.ast;08:01 in HPV-negative HNSCC. Discussion The Results indicate a possible predisposition to developing head neck cancer and HPV-positive HNSCC, respectively. A possible explanation could be a limited presentation of tumor specific antigens (Immune gap) caused by the mentioned HLA-alleles and therefore missing out of the Tumor.

AB  - Purpose or Objective To improve personalised treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a comprehensive biomarker trial was initiated by the German Cancer Consortium - Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG). Biomarkers that are identified in the retrospective part of this trial will be validated in a prospective validation cohort. Thus, the aim of this retrospective study was to define prognostic radiomic models for loco-regional control (LRC) after primary radiochemotherapy (pRCTx) using pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) imaging, before subsequent prospective validation. Material and Methods A multicentre cohort including 318 locally advanced HNSCC patients was collected and divided into training and validation cohorts (233 and 85 patients, respectively). All patients underwent a non-contrast-enhanced CT scan for treatment-planning and received pRCTx at one of six DKTK-ROG partner sites [1,2]. 458 imaging features were derived from the primary gross tumour volume (GTV); 16 clinical features were considered, including age, T and N stage, GTV and HPV status. Three prognostic models were developed for predicting LRC based on: (i) imaging features, (ii) clinical features, and (iii) a combination of both feature classes. Different machine learning algorithms were compared based on the training cohort as outlined in [2]. Model performance was measured using the concordance index (C-Index). Subsequently, patients were stratified into groups of low and high risk of loco-regional recurrence using the median risk value. Differences in LRC were assessed by the log-rank test. Results Elastic-net Cox regression models, after minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection, performed best in training and achieved the following Cindices in validation: (i) 0.62+/-0.05 (mean+/-std) for the model based on imaging features, (ii) 0.62+/-0.03 for clinical features, and (iii) 0.67+/-0.04 for the combination of imaging and clinical features. The model based on the selected clinical features GTV and N stage could not stratify patients from the validation cohort into groups with significantly different LRC (p=0.07), while the model based on imaging features and the combined model led to significant patient stratifications in validation (p=0.04, see figure). Selected imaging features were weakly correlated to GTV (R2<=0.3). Figure Presented Conclusion We developed and validated models that predict LRC for patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated by pRCTx. Combining CT imaging with clinical features improved model performance. In future, the developed models will be validated on the prospective HNSCC cohort of the DKTKROG once follow-up is complete. After combination with validated molecular biomarkers, they may be applied in a planned interventional trial on individual dose prescription. References: [1] Linge et al.

AB  - Background: Despite high-dose, cisplatin-containing, multimodality therapy, LA SCCHN ultimately recurs in many patients. This trial investigated whether avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, improved progression-free survival (PFS) when combined with concurrent CRT followed by avelumab maintenance. Method(s): This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial (JAVELIN Head and Neck 100; NCT02952586) included patients with histologically confirmed, previously untreated LA SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity eligible for definitive CRT with curative intent. Patients were required to have stage III, IVa, or IVb disease per AJCC (7th edition) except for HPV+ oropharyngeal patients, for whom only T4 or N2c or N3 status was allowed. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W + CRT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W + standard fractionation of 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks) or placebo + CRT. This was preceded by a lead-in dose and followed by avelumab or placebo maintenance therapy for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint was PFS by investigator assessment per modified RECIST v1.1; interim analysis was planned at = 217 events. Result(s): 697 patients were randomized (avelumab arm, n=350; placebo arm, n=347); baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. At interim analysis, the hazard ratios for PFS per modified RECIST v1.1 (based on 224 events) and overall survival (OS; based on 131 deaths) were 1.21 (95% CI: 0.93-1.57; p=0.920) and 1.31 (95% CI: 0.93-1.85; p=0.937), respectively, both in favor of placebo + CRT. Median PFS and OS were not reached in either arm. Grade >=3 adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with avelumab + CRT vs placebo + CRT (88% vs 82%); fatal AEs occurred in 6% and 5%, respectively. Rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug were similar in both arms (33% vs 32% in the avelumab vs placebo arms). Conclusion(s): Tolerability was similar in both arms; however, the study did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in PFS with avelumab + CRT vs placebo + CRT. These results may inform future trial design. Clinical trial identification: NCT02952586.

AB  - Purpose: In this pilot study we will evaluate a systematic approach towards human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling for non-responders to the German cervical cancer screening program. In 2020, an organized screening program with co-testing (HPV test + cytology) in 3-yearly intervals will be started. In the past, the participation rate was around 70% in a time frame of three years. The non-participators are at higher risk to develop cervical carcinoma. Previous studies have shown an improving number of patients participating when being re-invited. The willingness to participate in self sampling programs is even higher. Based on this information, the Hannover Self-Collection study was designed to examine the response rate and practicability of a systematic self-sampling approach. Method(s): 20.000 women aged 30 to 65 years living in the city and region of Hannover, Lower Saxony are randomly included. 10.000 women directly receive a self-sampling kit, the other 10.000 a letter of information and option to participate in the study (opt-out vs. opt-in strategy). Stratifications will be made by age (7 cohorts) and area of living (city vs rural). Women tested positive for high-risk HPV (PCR-based HPV assay) are prompted to get a cytological smear by their gynecologist. Women with normal cytology will be re-checked after 6 months. Suspicious cytology results lead to an immediate colposcopy. Further treatment will be performed according to the German S3-guideline prevention of cervical cancer. Result(s): We designed a prospective randomized study to primarily examine: I) the participation rate (opt-out vs. opt-in model), II) the compliance after a positive HPV test, III) the comparison between two self-sampling gadgets, IV) triaging the samples by new DNA-methylation tests. Conclusion(s): To get hold of non-responders to cervical cancer screening programs; self-sampling for HPV is a promising option. Aim of this study is to generate an overall recommendation to improve cervical cancer screening in Germany; especially for non-responders. This study is supported by Deutsche Krebshilfe.

AB  - Purpose: Persisting infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer. In 2007, routine HPV vaccination of girls was introduced into the national vaccination schedule in Germany. Vaccine coverage reached 44.6% in 2016. The two HPV vaccines on the German market confer protection against two or seven high-risk HPV types. Aim of our study was to investigate HPV prevalence in women aged 20-25 years and to estimate the effects of HPV vaccination ten years after the introduction of HPV vaccination. Method(s): We performed a nation-wide representative cross-sectional study in 2017-18 using a two-step stratified sampling design to recruit at least 1,173 women aged 20-25 years from population registries in Germany. Participants used self-sampling kits (Evalyn brush; Rovers, Oss, The Netherlands) to collect cervico-vaginal samples and completed questionnaires. Samples were tested for 18 high-risk and eight low-risk HPV types (genotyping HPV test; Optiplex; Diamex, Heidelberg). Result(s): In 1,202 of 1,226 study participants HPV test results as well as data on sociodemographic characteristics and HPV vaccination status were available. Overall response rate was 15%, ranging from 10 to 18% locally. Of 1,134 participants, 597 (53%) had received a full course of HPV vaccine. Further analyses on HPV type prevalence and vaccine effectiveness are in preparation and will be presented at the conference. Conclusion(s): Our study will generate estimates of HPV type distribution and assess the impact of HPV vaccination in Germany. These data will contribute to the evaluation of the national vaccination strategy and improve prevention of HPV-associated carcinoma in Germany (supported by BMG; grant no. 321-4471-02/158).

AB  - Cervical cancer is one of the most severe and prevalent female malignancies and a global health issue. The molecular mechanisms underlying cervical cancer development are poorly investigated. As a type of extracellular membrane vesicles, EVs from cancer cells are involved in cancer progression by delivering regulatory factors, such as proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, we identified an innovative function of extracellular vesicle (EV) lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 in regulating cervical cancer cell proliferation. The EVs were isolated from the cervical cancer cells and were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and were confirmed by analyzing exosome markers. The depletion of AGAP2-AS1 by siRNA significantly reduced its expression in the exosomes from cervical cancer and in the cervical cancer treated with AGAP2-AS1-knockdown exosomes. The expression of AGAP2-AS1 was elevated in the clinical cervical cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. The depletion of EV AGAP2-AS1 reduced cell viabilities and Edu-positive cervical cancer cells, while it enhanced cervical cancer cell apoptosis. Tumorigenicity analysis in nude mice showed that the silencing of EV AGAP2-AS1 attenuated cervical cancer cell growth in vivo. Regarding the mechanism, we identified that AGAP2-AS1 increased SIRT1 expression by sponging miR-3064-5p in cervical cancer cells. The overexpression of SIRT1 or the inhibition of miR-3064-5p reversed EV AGAP2-AS1 depletion-inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Consequently, we concluded that EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 contributed to cervical cancer cell proliferation through regulating the miR-3064-5p/SIRT1 axis. The clinical values of EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 and miR-3064-5p deserve to be explored in cervical cancer diagnosis and treatments.© Copyright © 2021 Li, Wang, Ma, Gao, Zhao and Huang.

AB  - Therapeutic options in recurrent or metastasized vulvar squamous cell cancer (VSCC) not amenable to radiotherapy or radical surgery are limited. Evidence for the use of targeted therapies is sparse. All patients with VSCC treated at the Gynecological Cancer Center Hamburg-Eppendorf 2013-2019 were retrospectively evaluated for targeted therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, a MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID database search was performed using the terms: "vulvar cancer" AND "targeted therapy," "erlotinib," "EGFR," "bevacizumab," "VEGF," "pembrolizumab," or "immunotherapy." Twelve of 291 patients (4.1%) with VSCC received at least one targeted therapy at our institution. Previously, one or more platinum-based chemotherapy was applied to all patients [median 3.5 previous lines (range 2-5)]. In the erlotinib subgroup, two of five patients (40%) achieved stable disease (SD), while two patients (2/5, 40%) experienced partial response (PR). Treatment was given as monotherapy in second/third line for a median of 3.4 months (range 2-6 months). Bevacizumab (n = 9) was given as maintenance therapy after platinum-based first-line chemotherapy (9/9); best response was complete response (CR) (n = 2/9 22.2%). Median duration of treatment was 7 months (range 4-13 months) with two patients still under ongoing treatment. Best response in the pembrolizumab (n = 3) subset was SD (n = 1/3 33%). Treatment was given as monotherapy in second/third line for a median of 3.3 months (range 3-4 months). Nine of 12 patients (75%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), most commonly grade 1/2. Rapidly evolving antibody treatments have proven clinical benefit especially in HPV-driven tumor entities; however, clinical investigations in VSCC are still limited. These reported cases provide evidence for the clinical utility and feasibility while ensuring an acceptable safety profile.Copyright © 2021 Cognizant, LLC.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are non-enveloped DNA viruses infecting cutaneous and mucosal squamous epithelia. Sexually transmitted HPV-types that are carcinogenic to humans such as HPV16 can induce cervical and other anogenital cancers. Virus transmission through fomites such as inadequately disinfected gynecological equipment is a further potential transmission route. Since HPV cannot be easily grown in cell culture, polyomavirus SV40 has been used as a surrogate virus when testing the virucidal activity of chemical disinfectants. So far, studies that have compared the virucidal activity of different disinfectants against HPV and SV40 are lacking. Here, we evaluated the susceptibility of HPV16 pseudovirus and SV40 to seven active biocidal substances using quantitative suspension tests. Ethanol, glutaraldehyde (GTA), dodecyldipropylentriamin (DPTA), and orthophthalaldehydes (OPA) were able to reduce the infectivity of HPV16 pseudovirus >99.99% after 5 min. In contrast, isopropanol, peracetic acid (PAA), and quaternary ammonium compounds with alkylamines (QAC) only led to a slight or no reduction in infectivity. Concerning SV40, only GTA (60 min contact time), PAA, and OPA had virus-inactivating effects. In conclusion, the virucidal activity of three out of seven disinfectants tested was different for HPV16 pseudovirus and SV40. In this study, SV40 was shown to be a reliable surrogate virus for HPV when testing isopropanol-, GTA-, QAC-, and OPA-based disinfectants.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study presents cross-sectional accuracy of E6 and E7 (E6/E7) mRNA detection and p16/ki67 dual staining, alone or in combination with cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 genotyping, as a triage test in HPV DNA-positive women and their impact on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) overdiagnosis. METHODS: Women aged 25-64 years were recruited. HPV DNA-positive women were triaged with cytology and tested for E6/E7 mRNA and p16/ki67. Cytology positive women were referred to colposcopy, and negatives were randomly assigned to immediate colposcopy or to 1-year HPV retesting. Lesions found within 24 months since recruitment were included. All P values were 2-sided. RESULTS: 40 509 women were recruited, and 3147 (7.8%) tested HPV DNA positive; 174 CIN2+ were found: sensitivity was 61.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 53.6 to 68.0), 94.4% (95% CI = 89.1 to 97.3), and 75.2% (95% CI = 68.1 to 81.6) for cytology, E6/E7 mRNA, and p16/ki67, respectively. Immediate referral was 25.6%, 66.8%, and 28.3%, respectively. Overall referral was 65.3%, 78.3%, and 63.3%, respectively. Cytology or p16/ki67, when combined with HPV16/18 typing, reached higher sensitivity with a small impact on referral. Among the 2306 HPV DNA-positive and cytology-negative women, relative CIN2+ detection in those randomly assigned at 1-year retesting vs immediate colposcopy suggests a -28% CIN2+ regression (95% CI = -57% to +20%); regression was higher in E6/E7 mRNA-negatives (Pinteraction = .29). HPV clearance at 1 year in E6/E7 mRNA and in p16/ki67 negative women was about 2 times higher than in positive women (Pinteraction < .001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: p16/ki67 showed good performance as a triage test. E6/E7 mRNA showed the highest sensitivity, at the price of too high a positivity rate to be efficient for triage. However, when negative, it showed a good prognostic value for clearance and CIN2+ regression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: miR-21, miR-214 and miR-let-7a are three validated and well-known miRNAs. miR-21 is described as an "oncomir" while miR-214 and miR-let-7a are described mainly as tumor suppressors. The role of these miRNAs remains unclear in cervical cancer, an important malignancy among women worldwide and responsible for many deaths every year. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the expression profile of miR-21, miR-214 and miR-let-7a in plasma and in cervical scraping from a control group and patients with different grades of cervical lesions and invasive cervical cancer and correlate with HPV infection groups. METHODS: Plasma and cervical scraping were submitted to DNA and RNA extraction. HPV detection and typing were performed by conventional PCR followed by PAGE to amplicons interpretation. The miRNA relative expression in plasma and cervical scraping samples was performed by real time PCR using specific TaqMan probes. RESULTS: miR-21 (p=0.0277) and miR-214 (p=0.0151) were up-regulated in cervical scraping samples of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) group. However, miR-214 was also up-regulated in the LSIL group (p=0.0062). Both miRNAs were not related to HPV infection. However, miR-let-7a was higher in HPV positive plasma samples (p=0.0433) than in HPV negative plasma samples and the correlation analysis confirmed the association between the levels of this miRNA with the presence of HPV (p=0.0407; r=0.3029), but not with lesion grade (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-21 is related to cervical cancer progression and miR-214 appears to have an ambiguous role in cervical lesions. miR-let-7a may be upregulated at a systemic level in patients with HPV infection.

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the cause of almost all cervical cancers. HPV16 is one of the main risk subtypes. Although screening programs have greatly reduced the prevalence of cervical cancer in developed countries, current diagnostic tests cannot predict if mild lesions may progress into invasive lesions or not. In the current cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical study, we found that the HPV16 E7-specific T cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HPV16-infected patients is related to HPV16 clearance. It contributes to protecting the squamous interaepithelial lesion (SIL) from further malignant development. Of the HPV16 infected women enrolled (n = 131), 42 had neither intraepithelial lesion nor malignancy (NILM), 33 had low-grade SIL, 39 had high-grade SIL, and 17 had cervical cancer. Only one of 17 (5.9%) cancer patients had a positive HPV16 E7-specific T cell response, dramatically lower than the groups of precancer patients. After one year of follow-up, most women (28/33, 84.8%) with persistent HPV infection did not exhibit a HPV16 E7-specific T cell response. Furthermore, 3 malignantly progressed women, one progressed to high-grade SIL and two progressed to low-grade SIL, were negative to the HPV16 E7-specific T cell response. None of the patients with a positive HPV16 E7-specific T cell response progressed to further deterioration. Our observation suggests that HPV16 E7-specific T cell immunity is significant in viral clearance and contributes in protection against progression to malignancy.

AB  - Background: Several studies have suggested a possible role of human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis of oral premalignant lesions. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between squamous dysplasia of the tongue and expression of p16 and Ki67 immunohistochemically as well as HPV genotypes with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Method(s): Twenty-three tongue biopsies were stained immunohistochemically for p16, Epstein-Barr virus and Ki67 and real-time PCR and chromogenic in-situ hybridization for HPV. Result(s): Dysplasia was diagnosed in 16 of 23 cases without invasive carcinoma and suspicious for dysplasia (n=17) and HPV infection (n=6). These were subjected to chromogenic in-situ hybridization for HPV DNA (HPV-III family 16). There was no immunoreactivity for Epstein-Barr virus. p16 was positive in 4/16 (25%) of dysplastic lesions. One lesion was positive for HPV by chromogenic in-situ hybridization, and one case was positive by real-time PCR for HPV. Conclusion(s): This evidence suggested that HPV infection but not Epstein-Barr virus infection plays a role in pathogenesis of squamous dysplasia localized tongue.Copyright © 2021 University of the West Indies.

AB  - Objective: The detection and treatment of high-grade cervical lesions prevent the development of invasive cervical cancer. Excisional procedures can pose a risk for subsequent pregnancies, thus conservative management of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) lesions should be adopted in young women. The aim of our study is to evaluate the ability of viral and cellular biomarkers in predicting regression/progression of CIN2. Method(s): Women aged 25 to 45 years, participating to population-based organised cervical cancer screening programmes in the Veneto Region (Italy), diagnosed with a CIN2 lesion and fitting predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, are invited to take part in a multicentre observational longitudinal cohort study with a follow-up of 24 months. Upon signing an informed consent, women are enrolled in the study and cervical cell samples collected. Treatment is delayed and subsequently performed in the case of lesion progression, or persistence for >12 months. HPV genotyping, p16INK4A/ki67 expression and methylation status for L1 viral sequences and FAM19A4/miR124-2 cellular genes are determined at baseline and during follow-up, and evaluated in relation to the clinical outcome. Result(s): The study, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04687267), is currently ongoing. Enrolment of women aged 25-45 years started in 2019, and will continue up to the end of 2021. Discussion(s): Since February 2020, the Veneto Region has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The enrolment of women in the study was interrupted during an initial two-month lockdown, and slowed down during the subsequent months. The 12-month extension of the study period will partially counterbalance this delay.Copyright ©2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The genetic predisposition to head and neck carcinomas (HNSCC) and how the known risk factors (papillomavirus infection, alcohol, and tobacco consumption) contribute to the early-onset disease are barely explored. Although HNSCC at early onset is rare, its frequency is increasing in recent years. Germline and somatic variants were assessed to build a comprehensive genetic influence pattern in HNSCC predisposition and patient outcome. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 45 oral and oropharynx carcinomas paired with normal samples of young adults (<=49 years). We found FANCG, CDKN2A, and TPP germline variants previously associated with HNSCC risk. At least one germline variant in DNA repair pathway genes was detected in 67% of cases. Germline and somatic variants (including copy number variations) in FAT1 gene were identified in 9 patients (20%) and 12 tumors (30%), respectively. Somatic variants were found in HNSCC associated genes, such as TP53, CDKN2A, and PIK3CA. To date, 55 of 521 cases from the large cohort of TCGA presented < 49 years old. A comparison between the somatic alterations of TCGA-HNSCC at early onset and our dataset revealed strong similarities. Protein-protein interaction analysis between somatic and germline altered genes revealed a central role of TP53. Altogether, germline alterations in DNA repair genes potentially contribute to an increased risk of developing HNSCC at early-onset, while FAT1 could impact the prognosis.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 early promoter and L1 gene methylation were quantitatively measured using pyrosequencing assay in anal cells collected from men who have sex with men (MSM) to determine potential biomarkers for HPV-related anal cancer. The methylation patterns of HPV16 genes, including the early promoter (CpG 31, 37, 43, 52, and 58) and L1 genes (CpG 5600, 5606, 5609, 5615, 7136, and 7145), were analyzed in 178 anal samples. The samples were diagnosed as normal, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 1, AIN2, and AIN3. Low methylation levels of the early promoter (< 10%) and L1 genes (< 20%) were found in all detected normal anal cells. In comparison, medium to high methylation (>/= 20-60%) in the early promoter was found in 1.5% (1/67) and 5% (2/40) of AIN1 and AIN2-3 samples, respectively. Interestingly, slightly increased L1 gene methylation levels (>/= 20-60%), especially at the HPV16 5'L1 regions CpGs 5600 and 5609, were demonstrated in AIN2-3 specimen. Moreover, a negative correlation between high HPV16 L1 gene methylation at CpGs 5600, 5609, 5615, and 7145 and a percentual CD4 count was found in AIN3 HIV positive cases. When comparing the methylation status of AIN2-3 to that of normal/AIN1 lesions, the results indicated the potential of using HPV16 L1 gene methylation as a biomarker for HPV-related cancer screening.

AB  - Background: The SelfCerv Self-Collection Cervical Health Screening Kit (Ilex Medical Ltd., Johannesburg, South Africa) is an applicator tampon designed for self-collection of vaginal samples for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and E6/E7 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The study aimed to evaluate the performance of the SelfCerv applicator tampon for the detection of hr-HPV for cervical cancer screening, and further to investigate women's experiences and preferences regarding self-sampling. Method(s): Vaginal samples were collected from 527 gynecology clinic attendees aged >=18 years at a tertiary hospital in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Self-samples were collected using the SelfCerv kit, followed by endocervical samples collected by a healthcare professional using Cervex-Brush Combi. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on self-sampling experiences and preferences. Both samples were tested for 14 high-risk (hr) HPV types and E6/E7 mRNA using the Abbott RealTime HR-HPV and Aptima HR-HPV mRNA assays, respectively. Result(s): The overall agreement for hr-HPV typing between 527 paired samples was good (87.1%; kappa =0.74) with high sensitivity (86.2%) and specificity (88.0%). HPV-16 (96.4%; kappa = 0.83) had higher agreement rate than HPV-18 (96.8%; kappa = 0.72) and the other 12 hr-HPVs (86.5%; kappa = 0.72). Two hundred and eighty-five (285) sample pairs tested for E6/E7 mRNA showed fair agreement (70.2%; kappa= 0.34). Furthermore, self-sampling was reported as comfortable (90.5%) and painless (86.7%), with 88.4% of women preferring self-collection. Conclusion(s): Self-collected samples had good agreement with the healthcare professional-collected samples for the detection of hr-HPV DNA and the procedure was highly preferred by women. Self-sampling using SelfCerv can be used as an alternative to healthcare professional sampling in clinic-based routine cervical cancer screening.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: In 2017, the South African National Department of Health (NDoH) Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control Policy was revised. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on self-collected samples may offer improved screening uptake. The objectives of the study were to compare the positivity of high-risk (hr)-HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and hrHPV viral messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) between healthcare worker-collected cervical and self-collected vaginal samples and investigate the accuracy of the applicator-tampon-based self-collected samples in detecting hrHPV DNA and hrHPV mRNA. Method(s): A total of 527 women aged 18 years and older and seeking gynecology services at a tertiary hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, were enrolled. Vaginal samples were self-collected using SelfCerv applicator tampon, followed by cervical samples collected by a healthcare worker using a Cervex Brush Combi. Both samples were tested with the Abbott m2000 analyzer for 14-hrHPV types and 285 paired samples were tested for hrHPV E6/E7 mRNA using the Aptima HR-HPV mRNA assay. The prevalence of hrHPV DNA and hrHPV E6/E7 mRNA was estimated and the positivity between the two collection methods was compared for the total group as well as per age group. Result(s): HrHPV prevalence was 48.0% (95% CI 43.7-52.4) among healthcare worker collected samples and 47.6% (95% CI 43.3-52.0) among self-collected samples. There was no difference in positivity between healthcare worker collection (48.0%) and applicator-tampon-based self-collection, 47.6% (p-value = 0.90). The proportions of hrHPV were equal between the age groups as shown by the McNemar test (p = 0.9036) results for correlated proportions. The prevalence of hrHPV mRNA was 78.6% (95% CI 73.4-83.2) and 58.6% (95% CI 52.6-64.4) for healthcare worker- and self-collection, respectively. The McNemar test for correlated proportions was highly significant (p < 0.0001), indicating that the hrHPV mRNA proportions are not comparable, although this differed between age groups. Conclusion(s): Applicator-tampon-based self-collection has a comparable hrHPV DNA positivity rate as healthcare worker collection but different positivity rates for hrHPV mRNA. Self-sampling showed high concordance with healthcare worker-collected sampling for hrHPV DNA detection, especially regarding HPV 16/18 detection. HrHPV DNA was equally detected between the total group as well as per age group. Implementation of self-sampling using an applicator tampon as a primary screening tool may be considered.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are causative for cervical neoplasia and carcinomas. Despite the availability of prophylactic vaccines, morbidity and mortality induced by HPV are still too high. Thus, an efficient therapy, such as a therapeutic vaccine, is urgently required. Herein, we describe the development and validation of Macaca fascicularis papillomavirus type 3 (MfPV3) antigens delivered via nucleic-acid and adenoviral vectors in outbred mouse models. Ten artificially fused polypeptides comprising early viral regulatory proteins were designed and optionally linked to the T cell adjuvant MHC-II-associated invariant chain. Transfected HEK293 cells and A549 cells transduced with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the same panel of artificial antigens proved proper and comparable expression, respectively. Immunization of outbred CD1 and OF1 mice led to CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against MfPV3 antigens after DNA- and adenoviral vector delivery. Moreover, in vivo cytotoxicity of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells was demonstrated in BALB/c mice by quantifying specific killing of transferred peptide-pulsed syngeneic target cells. The use of the invariant chain as T cell adjuvant enhanced the T cell responses regarding cytotoxicity and in vitro analysis suggested an accelerated turnover of the antigens as causative. Notably, the fusion-polypeptide elicited the same level of T-cell responses as administration of the antigens individually, suggesting no loss of immunogenicity by fusing multiple proteins in one vaccine construct. These data support further development of the vaccine candidates in a follow up efficacy study in persistently infected Macaca fascicularis monkeys to assess their potential to eliminate pre-malignant papillomavirus infections, eventually instructing the design of an analogous therapeutic HPV vaccine.© Copyright © 2021 Neckermann, Boilesen, Willert, Pertl, Schrodel, Thirion, Asbach, Holst and Wagner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A profound insight into the immune landscape of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) is lacking. Here, an in-depth interrogation of T cell infiltration, local immune contexture, signaling pathways and checkpoint molecule expression was performed in early-stage and late-stage VSCC. METHODS: The type, location, and infiltration pattern of T cells were studied in 109 patients with primary VSCC FIGO stage I-III. RNA expression of genes involved in immune oncology and oncogenic signaling pathways was analyzed in 40 VSCC, matched for prognostic clinicopathological variables, analyzed for HPV and p53 status, and selected based on T cell infiltration. RESULTS: High intraepithelial infiltration with CD4 or CD8 T cells was associated with longer overall and recurrence-free survival and formed an independent prognostic factor, outperforming molecular subtype and stage of the disease. Strong T cell infiltrated VSCC displayed a coordinated immune response reflected by a positive association between T cells and different lymphocyte and myeloid cell subsets. The expression of genes involved in the migration of T cells and myeloid cells, T cell activation and costimulation, interferon (IFN)-gamma signaling, cytotoxicity and apoptosis was higher than in low infiltrated tumors. An active immune signaling profile was observed in all inflamed, part of the altered-excluded and not in altered-immunosuppressed or deserted VSCC. While several checkpoint molecules were overexpressed, only PD-L1 expression displayed discriminatory ability and clinical usefulness. High PD-L1 expression was detected in all inflamed and ~60% of the altered-excluded VSCC. CONCLUSION: An active immune signaling profile is present in 35% of primary FIGO I-III VSCCs, suggesting potential responsiveness to neoadjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.

AB  - Background: Microbial dysbiosis and microbiome-induced inflammation have emerged as important factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumorigenesis during the last two decades. However, the "rare biosphere" of the oral microbiome, including fungi, has been sparsely investigated. This study aimed to characterize the salivary mycobiome in a prospective Sudanese cohort of OSCC patients and to explore patterns of diversities associated with overall survival (OS). Material(s) and Method(s): Unstimulated saliva samples (n = 72) were collected from patients diagnosed with OSCC (n = 59) and from non-OSCC control volunteers (n = 13). DNA was extracted using a combined enzymatic-mechanical extraction protocol. The salivary mycobiome was assessed using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methodology by amplifying the ITS2 region. The impact of the abundance of different fungal genera on the survival of OSCC patients was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analyses (SPPS). Result(s): Sixteen genera were identified exclusively in the saliva of OSCC patients. Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, Aspergillus, and Cyberlindnera were the most relatively abundant fungal genera in both groups and showed higher abundance in OSCC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed higher salivary carriage of the Candida genus significantly associated with poor OS of OSCC patients (Breslow test: p = 0.043). In contrast, the higher salivary carriage of Malassezia showed a significant association with favorable OS in OSCC patients (Breslow test: p = 0.039). The Cox proportional hazards multiple regression model was applied to adjust the salivary carriage of both Candida and Malassezia according to age (p = 0.029) and identified the genus Malassezia as an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio = 0.383, 95% CI = 0.16-0.93, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): The fungal compositional patterns in saliva from OSCC patients were different from those of individuals without OSCC. The fungal genus Malassezia was identified as a putative prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for OSCC.© Copyright © 2021 Mohamed, Litlekalsoy, Ahmed, Martinsen, Furriol, Javier-Lopez, Elsheikh, Gaafar, Morgado, Mundra, Johannessen, Osman, Nginamau, Suleiman and Costea.

AB  - Context: It has been more than 10 years since the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program was initiated in most advanced countries. Thus, it seems necessary to change the uterine cervical cancer screening strategy. Molecular-based tests are considered essential in this scenario. Objective(s): We aimed to review the distribution of the HPV genotypes after the introduction of the vaccination program with Cervarix and Gardasil 4 in two autonomous communities in Spain, looking for possible changes in distribution and the occurrence of a herd effect. Design(s): A cross-sectional study was performed in 45,362 samples that were processed in the Cantabria and Aragon communities during the period from 2002 to 2016. We compared the genotype distribution before and after the vaccination program was initiated. Result(s): Genotypes HPV6 and HPV11 have decreased significantly after the introduction of the vaccine. HPV16 has had a decrease, but not a significant one in the statistical analysis. However, HPV31, HPV52, and HPV45 have increased in percentage. A replacement phenomenon with other genotypes not included in the vaccine has been observed in our population. Conclusion(s): Continued surveillance is needed to provide further indication of any changes over time in the genotypes in circulation. This will be facilitated by monitoring the genotyping results from the new model of cervical screening using primary HPV DNA testing.© Copyright © 2021 Freire-Salinas, Benito, Azueta, Gil, Mendoza, Nicolas, Garcia-Berbel, Algarate and Gomez-Roman.

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) infection of the cervicovaginal tract is known to be the major cause of cervical cancer. Similar to various other countries, Germany introduced an organized combined screening including cytology and HPV testing in 2020. The participation rate was around 70% in the past. Self-testing for hr-HPV infections could be an option to increase the participation rate. Two dry vaginal self-sampling devices and a device for the self-collection of first-void urine were evaluated in combination with a PCR-based hr-HPV test regarding their clinical performance (sensitivity for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN 2+). A cervical smear taken by a clinician during colposcopy was used as reference. This open prospective multicenter trial recruited patients referred to the two participating colposcopy clinics (Hannover Medical School and IZD Hannover, Germany) with abnormal results from cervical cancer screening from 05/2020 to 11/2020. All patients received three CE-certified self-sampling devices (FLOQSwabs, COPAN, Italy; Evalyn Brush, Rovers Medical Devices, the Netherlands; Colli-Pee FV-5000, Novosanis, Wijnegem, Belgium) with instructions to read and apply at home in a pre-specified alternating order without medical assistance. HPV testing was performed after adequate preservation and DNA extraction. Histological results from colposcopy or cervical excisional surgery after self-sampling were used as the gold-standard. The data of 65 patients were analyzed. All invasive cancer cases and over 90% of the CIN 3 lesions were found to be hr-HPV positive with all three self-collection devices. All devices were considered easy to use without any difficulties following the written instructions. Hr-HPV testing of self-collected first-void urine and dry vaginal self-samples showed a high sensitivity for CIN 3+ comparable to that of a clinician-taken smear. Self-sampling was well accepted as it is convenient and easy to use.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - There is growing evidence that equine papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV2) infection is etiologically associated with the development of genital squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and precursor lesions in equids. However, the precise mechanisms underlying neoplastic progression remain unknown. To allow the study of EcPV2-induced carcinogenesis, we aimed to establish a primary equine cell culture model of EcPV2 infection. Three-dimensional (3D) raft cultures were generated from equine penile perilesional skin, plaques and SCCs. Using histological, molecular biological and immunohistochemical methods, rafts versus corresponding natural tissue sections were compared with regard to morphology, presence of EcPV2 DNA, presence and location of EcPV2 gene transcripts and expression of epithelial, mesenchymal and tumor/proliferation markers. Raft cultures from perilesional skin harboring only a few EcPV2-positive (EcPV2+) cells accurately recapitulated the differentiation process of normal skin, whilst rafts from EcPV2+ penile plaques were structurally organized but showed early hyperplasia. Rafts from EcPV2+ SCCs exhibited pronounced hyperplasia and marked dysplasia. Raft levels of EcPV2 oncogene transcription (E6/E7) and expression of tumor/proliferation markers p53, Ki67 and MCM7 expression positively correlated with neoplastic progression, again reflecting the natural situation. Three-dimensional raft cultures accurately reflected major features of corresponding ex vivo material, thus constituting a valuable new research model to study EcPV2-induced carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - It is suggested that HPV-18 variants from the A lineage have higher oncogenic potential compared to B variants. Some studies show uneven distribution of HPV-18 variants in cervical adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Regarding HPV-18 variants' functions, the few studies reported focus on E6, and none were performed using natural host cells. Here, we immortalized primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) with E6/E7 of HPV-18 A1 and B1 sublineages and functionally characterized these cells. PHK18A1 reached immortalization significantly faster than PHK18B1 and formed a higher number of colonies in monolayer and 3D cultures. Moreover, PHK18A1 showed greater invasion ability and higher resistance to apoptosis induced by actinomycin-D. Nevertheless, no differences were observed regarding morphology, proliferation after immortalization, migration, or epithelial development in raft cultures. Noteworthy, our study highlights qualitative differences among HPV-18 A1 and B1 immortalized PHKs: in contrast to PHK18A1, which formed more compact colonies and spheroids of firmly grouped cells and tended to invade and migrate as clustered cells, morphologically, PHK18B1 colonies and spheroids were looser, and migration and invasion of single cells were observed. Although these observations may be relevant for the association of these variants with cervical cancer of different histological subtypes, further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings.

AB  - Background: Chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for unresected locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We aimed to assess if addition of avelumab (anti-PD-L1) to chemoradiotherapy could improve treatment outcomes for this patient population. Method(s): In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, patients were recruited from 196 hospitals and cancer treatment centres in 22 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, with histologically confirmed, previously untreated, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity (unselected for PD-L1 status), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and who could receive chemoradiotherapy were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally by means of stratified block randomisation with block size four (stratified by human papillomavirus status, tumour stage, and nodal stage, and done by an interactive response technology system) to receive 10 mg/kg avelumab intravenously every 2 weeks plus chemoradiotherapy (100 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy with standard fractionation of 70 Gy [35 fractions during 7 weeks]; avelumab group) or placebo plus chemoradiotherapy (placebo group). This was preceded by a single 10 mg/kg avelumab or placebo lead-in dose given 7 days previously and followed by 10 mg/kg avelumab or placebo every 2 weeks maintenance therapy for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by investigator assessment per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, in all randomly assigned patients. Adverse events were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of avelumab or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02952586. Enrolment is no longer ongoing, and the trial has been discontinued. Finding(s): Between Dec 12, 2016, and Jan 29, 2019, from 907 patients screened, 697 patients were randomly assigned to the avelumab group (n=350) or the placebo group (n=347). Median follow-up for progression-free survival was 14.6 months (IQR 8.5-19.6) in the avelumab group and 14.8 months (11.6-18.8) in the placebo group. Median progression-free survival was not reached (95% CI 16.9 months-not estimable) in the avelumab group and not reached (23.0 months-not estimable) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1.21 [95% CI 0.93-1.57] favouring the placebo group; one-sided p=0.92). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (57 [16%] of 348 patients in the avelumab group vs 52 [15%] of 344 patients in the placebo group), mucosal inflammation (50 [14%] vs 45 [13%]), dysphagia (49 [14%] vs 47 [14%]), and anaemia (41 [12%] vs 44 [13%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 124 (36%) patients in the avelumab group and in 109 (32%) patients in the placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in two (1%) patients in the avelumab group (due to general disorders and site conditions, and vascular rupture) and one (<1%) in the placebo group (due to acute respiratory failure). Interpretation(s): The primary objective of prolonging progression-free survival with avelumab plus chemoradiotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck was not met. These findings may help inform the design of future trials investigating the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors plus CRT.

AB  - Introduction: As the leading sexually transmitted infection worldwide, human papillomavirus (HPV) may disproportionately affect transwomen. We aimed to estimate anal HPV prevalence, especially focusing on high-risk (hr)-HPV types and evaluate their associated factors among transwomen living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Method(s): Transwomen enrolled in a respondent-driven sampling (RDS)-based survey conducted between August 2015 and January 2016 self-collected anal samples, which were promptly stored at minus 80degreeC. After DNA extraction, HPV detection and genotyping were performed using the PapilloCheck test. We estimated HPV prevalences and evaluated the correlates of anal hr-HPV infection using a regression logistic model. Result(s): Out of 345 transwomen, 272 (78.8%) were included in this analysis (122 [44.9%] HIV-positive). No participant had ever received HPV vaccination. Among participants enrolled, 212 (77.9%) were positive for any anal HPV type and 165 (60.7%) for hr-HPV. Most common hr-HPV were as follows: HPV16 (17.6%), HPV68 (14.7%), HPV39 (14.3%), HPV56 (12.5%), HPV51 (11.4%) and HPV52 (11.0%). HIV-positive transwomen had three times the odds of having an hr-HPV compared to HIV-negative transwomen. Participants who had a current rectal Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection had 3.7 times the odds of being coinfected with hr-HPV. Among HIV-positive transwomen, neither antiretroviral therapy use, undetectable viral load, current and nadir CD4 counts were associated with anal hr-HPV infection. Conclusion(s): Brazilian transwomen in our study exhibit some of the highest population-specific rates of HPV and hr-HPV. There is an urgent need to elucidate the burden of HPV infection, prevalence of HPV-related diseases and access to and uptake of HPV vaccination among transwomen, especially from low- and middle-income settings.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: head and neck cancers have essentially been a disease of the elderly but recent studies are beginning to demonstrate their increasing incidence in young people with infections such as human papilloma virus (HPV). This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of high risk Human papilloma virus (hrHPV) related oropharyngeal carcinoma and its prevalent genotypes as well as their strength of association with HIV in adult Nigerian subjects. Method(s): this was a cross-sectional study of 41 patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas seen over a 2-year period. Patients had incisional and/or excisional biopsy done under anesthesia. A portion of the specimen from which the DNA was extracted was placed in Digene HC2 DNA collection device while the 2nd portion for histopathological analysis was fixed using 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) and embedded in paraffin blocks. Oropharyngeal cancer HPV genotyping was done using HPV genotypes 14 real-tm quant kit (SACACE, Italy). The data was analyzed using SPSS version 23. Result(s): prevalence of HPV was 17.1% with a male to female ratio of 2.7: 1. The identified genotypes were 16,33,35 and 52 with 28.6% of patients having more than one genotype. Most of the age groups studied were affected. Squamous cell carcinoma and Ameloblastic carcinoma were the cancers associated with HPV. HPV was not identified in the HIV positive patients. Conclusion(s): high-risk human papilloma virus genotypes 16, 33, 35 and 52 are associated with oropharyngeal carcinoma in Nigeria but were not found in HIV patients. This finding provides a strong evidence for the use of the 9-valent prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer in Nigeria. Public awareness and HPV prevention strategies should reduce significantly the incidence of oropharyngeal carcinomas in our environment.Copyright Benjamin Idemudia Akhiwu et al.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to present a case of penile squamous cell carcinoma and immunohistochemical identification and evaluation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression. Method(s): We are presenting a 70-year old man with a variant of penile squamous cell carcinoma with mixed warty and basaloid features. After diagnosis, the patient underwent partial penectomy. Samples taken from the material after surgery were subjected to basic histological staining and immunohistochemical identification of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. A Real-time PCR study was conducted to investigate the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Result(s): Routine histopathological examinations revealed the characteristic features of warty-basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. In the case studied, a positive immunohistochemical reaction was observed for E-cadherin and beta-catenin. QRT-PCR analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in E-cadherin expression in tumor samples compared to healthy tissue. In contrast, expression of the gene encoding beta-catenin was slightly higher in tumor samples compared to normal tissue. Conclusion(s): The reduced level of the complex of adhesive elements, E-cadherin-beta-catenin, disturbs cell differentiation, promotes a more invasive phenotype-stromal infiltration and the formation of distant metastases. In the described case of the penile tumor, a decrease in E-cadherin expression was noted, which could be related to the occurrence of neoplastic infiltration of the spongy body space. In summary, E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression and the immunoreactivity of these proteins are expressed at different levels in tumor cells and in penile interstitial cells. Regulation of expression during various physiological and pathophysiological processes indicates a potentially important role of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in cell proliferation and adhesion.Copyright © 2021 Domian, Mlynarczyk and Kasacka.

AB  - Introduction: Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) entails a heterogeneous group of tumours that emerge from the interaction between molecular changes and environmental factors. Dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a major part in tumourigenesis and could be used as cancer biomarkers and therapeutic aims. Aim(s): To evaluate the expression of two lncRNAs named Fer-1 Like Family Member 4 (Fer1L4) and differentiation antagonising nonprotein-coding RNA (DANCR) in tumoural tissue of HNSCCs patients in comparison to Adjacent Noncancerous Tissues (ANCTs) to appraise their diagnostic power and the relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Material(s) and Method(s): We designed a case-control study, in which fresh frozen cancerous tissues and ANCTs were taken from 50 sporadic HNSCC patients who were attended in Imam Khomeini and Amir Alam Hospitals (Tehran, Iran) from from January to December 2019. Real-time PCR was utilised for expression profiling of Fer1L4 and DANCR. By employing GraphPad Prism 8.0 GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, the real-time quantitative PCR experiments(2-..Ct) method and the Mann-Whitney test were exerted to analyse the obtained data. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed for figuring out the discrimination potential of two selected lncRNAs between the subject tumour and ANCT. Result(s): The expression of Fer1L4 was significantly down-regulated in tumoural tissues by analogy to ANCTs (p-value <0.0001) and statistically significant associations were found between the stage and grade status of the tumour with the relative expression of this lncRNA (p-value=0.008 and p-value=0.002 for stage and grade, respectively). The findings in this study indicated that the expression of DANCR was not statistically significant different in different tumoural tissues compared with ANCTs (p-value=0.46). ROC curve unraveled that the Fer1L4 had good diagnostic power Area Under Curve(AUC) 0.9252; p-value<0.0001. The expression of DANCR and Fer1L4 was significantly, respectively, higher and lower in samples with lymph node invasion and metastasis than that of the counterpart group. Concerning Human Papillomavirus (HPV) as an important exogenous factor for the development of HNSCC, DANCR and Fer1L4 were over-expressed and under-expressed, respectively in the HPV+group in comparison to HPV-. Conclusion(s): This work represented that Fer1L4 could be used as a novel diagnostic biomarker for HNSCC. In addition, the statistically significant difference in the expression of Fer1L4 and DANCR in metastatic tumours demonstrated that these two lncRNAs are promising targets for therapeutic purposes.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

AB  - Objectives: In high-income countries, a high proportion of cervical cancers is diagnosed in screening non-attendees. One approach to improve screening coverage is to offer self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. However, especially young women are often HPV positive without having a precancerous lesion in need of treatment. To improve the rather low specificity of HPV testing additional markers such as DNA-methylation can be used. The aim of this feasibility study was to examine the performance of the methylation marker assay GynTect, comprising six methylation markers, on dry self-collected cervico-vaginal samples compared to physician-taken samples. Method(s): We recruited 89 patients from our colposcopy clinic of whom 87 qualified for the study. The women took a self-sample with the Evalyn-Brush. Afterwards the planned colposcopy was performed and smears for cytology and reference HPV testing were taken as well as a biopsy in cases of abnormalities. Physician-taken and self-collected samples were tested for HPV DNA and were analyzed with GynTect. Result(s): We obtained 95.5 % valid results for the self-collected samples which was very close to the physician-taken samples. Only about half of the self-collected samples were GynTect positive in comparison to the physician-taken samples. GynTect scores were significantly lower for self-collected than for physician-taken samples (p = 0.001, paired t-test). The overall concordance for GynTect results was moderate (kappa 0.394; p < 0.001). For HPV testing we obtained a good concordance (kappa 0.586; p < 0.001). The GynTect results for the self-collected samples showed a sensitivity for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN2+) of 26.1 % (95 %-CI: 0.13-0.46) and a specificity of 95.6 % (95 %-CI: 0.85-0.99), in comparison to a sensitivity of 45.5 % (95 %-CI: 0.27-0.65) and a specificity of 78.3 % (95 %-CI: 0.64-0.88) for the physician-taken samples. Conclusion(s): GynTect methylation marker testing has a satisfactory amount of valid results on self-collected samples. However, the results of the self-collected samples differed clearly in comparison to the reference samples. To justify an application in screening, a larger study with more cases of high-grade cervical dysplasia and HPV positive patients will be needed.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The number of anal cancer diagnoses has been rising steadily, so that the incidence has doubled in the past 20 years. Almost all anal cancers are induced by persistent infection with human papillomaviruses. Hitherto the care of patients with anal cancer has been heterogeneous and little experience exists with the primary management of anal cancer. Method(s): The guideline was developed in accordance with the requirements of the German Guideline Program in Oncology. In line with the GRADE approach, the certainty of the evidence was assessed on the outcome level following a systematic literature search. Interdisciplinary working groups were set up to compile suggestions for recommendations, which were discussed and agreed upon in a formal consensus conference. Result(s): Ninety-three recommendations and statements were developed. No high-quality evidence was available to support recommendations for or against the treatment of stage I anal cancer with local excision alone as an alternative to chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy is the gold standard in the treatment of stages II-III. Among other aspects regarding the timing and extent of response evaluation after chemoradiotherapy, the guideline panel recommended against obtaining a biopsy in the event of complete clinical response. Owing to lack of confidence in the available evidence, only open recommendations were given for treatment of stage IV. Conclusion(s): This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides a sound basis for optimizing the interdisciplinary, cross-sector care of anal cancer patients. Among other areas, gaps in research were identified with respect to the care of patients with early-stage or metastatic anal cancer. Approaches such as chemoradiotherapy combined with regional deep hyperthermia require further investigation. The role for immunotherapy in the management of metastasized anal cancer has also been insufficiently explored to date.Copyright © 2021 Deutscher Arzte-Verlag GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Approximately 15% of human cancers are attributed to viruses. Numerous studies have shown that high-risk human polyomaviruses (HR-HPV) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) are two human tumor viruses associated with anogenetal and oropharyngeal cancers, and with Merkel cell carcinoma, respectively. MCPyV has been found in HR-HPV positive anogenetal and oropharyngeal tumors, suggesting that MCPyV can act as a co-factor in HR-HPV induced oncogenesis. This prompted us to investigate whether the oncoproteins large T-antigen (LT) and small antigen (sT) of MCPyV could affect the transcriptional activity HPV16 and HPV18 and vice versa whether HPV16 and HPV18 E6 and E7 oncoproteins affected the expression of MCPyV LT and sT. Reciprocal stimulation of these viral oncoproteinscould enhance the oncogenic processes triggered by these tumor viruses. Method(s): Transient co-transfection studies using a luciferase reporter plasmid with the long control region of HPV16 or HPV18, or the early or late promoter of MCPyV and expression plasmids for LT and sT, or E6 and E7, respectively were performed in the HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line C33A, in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, and in the oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-3. Transfections were also performed with deletion mutants of all these promoters and with mutants of all four oncoproteins. Finally, the effect of E6 and E7 on LT and sT expression in the MCPyV-positive Merkel cell carcinoma cell line WaGa and the effect of LT and sT on the expression of E6 and E7 was monitored by Western blotting. Result(s): LT and sT stimulated the transcriptional activity of the HPV16 and HPV18 LCR and v.v. E6 and E7 potentiated the MCPyV early and late promoter in all cell lines. Induction by E6 and E7 was p53- and pRb-independent, and transactivation by LT did not require DNA binding, nuclear localization and HSC70/pRb interaction, whereas sT stimulated the HPV16/18 LCR activity in a PP2A- and DnaJ-independent manner. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the co-infection of MCPyV may act as a co-factor in the initiation and/or progression of HPV-induced cancers.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of p16/ki-67 dual stain in the identification of CIN2+ lesions, in Greek women with ASCUS or LSIL cytology. METHODS: A total of 200 women, 20 to 60 years old, were enrolled in the study. All samples were cytologically evaluated and performed for p16/ki-67 and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) test. All patients were referred to colposcopy for biopsy and histological evaluation. Three cervical cancer (CC) screening strategies were designed and the total direct medical costs of the procedures during our clinical trial were evaluated, from a healthcare perspective. RESULTS: HPV 16 as expected was the most common HR-HPV type followed by HPV 31 and HPV 51. The risk for CIN2+ was significantly higher in HPV 16/18 positive cases. p16/ki-67 demonstrated a high sensitivity for CIN2+ identification in both ASCUS and LSIL groups (90.4% and 95%, respectively). HR-HPV test with sensitivity 52.3% and 65.5%, as well as colposcopy with sensitivity 14.3% and 36% respectively in ASCUS and LSIL group, showed inferior results compared to p16/ki-67. The specificity of p16/ki-67 for ASCUS and LSIL was 97.2% and 95.2% respectively, inferior only to colposcopy: 100% and 100%, lacking however statistical significance. HR-HPV test instead, presented the lowest specificity: 76.4% and 71.4% respectively in comparison to the other two methods. From a healthcare perspective, the costs and benefits of the tests implementation for the annual screening and triaging, in three CC screening strategies, were also calculated and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that p16/ki-67 is a safe and rapid assay that could be used to detect CIN2+ among women with mild cervical lesions, presenting both high sensitivity and specificity and could minimize the psychological and economic burden of HPV screening.

AB  - Interaction of the long control region (LCR) and the E2 protein of HPV11s was studied by in silico modelling and in vitro functional analysis. Genomes of HPV11s from fifteen (six known and nine novel) patients (two solitary papillomas, eleven respiratory papillomatoses of different severity, one condyloma acuminatum and one cervical atypia) were sequenced; E2 polymorphisms were analysed in silico by protein modelling. E2 and LCR variants were cloned into pcDNA3.1+ expression vector and into pALuc reporter vector, respectively, transfected to HEp2 cells alone or in different combinations and the luciferase activity was measured. In the E2, the ubiquitous polymorphism K308R caused stronger binding between the dimers but did not alter DNA binding; E2s with this polymorphism were significantly less efficient than the reference in promoting LCR activity. The unique polymorphism Q86K changed the negative surface charge of E2 (Q86) to positive (K86). The unique polymorphisms S245F and N247T in the hinge region disrupt a probable phosphorylation site in a RXXS motif targeted by protein kinase A and B, but do not affect directly the amino acids critical to nuclear transport. Both unique patterns partly restored the LCR activating potential disrupted by K308R. A unique E2/E4 ORF with a 58-bp deletion leading to a frameshift and an early stop codon resulted in a practically nonfunctional E2, and was associated with a papillomatosis with dysplasia. When testing existing LCR-E2 combinations, LCR with intrinsically lower enhancer capacity was only marginally activated by its E2 (R308 and the deletion mutant), and did not significantly exceed the activity of the reference LCR without E2. Combined with more potent LCRs associated with more severe disease, the activity was significantly higher, but still significantly lower than LCRs with reference E2. In summary, LCR-E2 interaction determined by their polymorphisms may explain, at least partly, differences in disease severity.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The EGFR-targeting antibody cetuximab (CTX) combined with radiotherapy is the only targeted therapy that has been proven effective for the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC). Recurrence arises in 50% of patients with HNSCC in the years following treatment. In clinicopathological practice, it is difficult to assign patients to classes of risk because no reliable biomarkers are available to predict the outcome of HPV-unrelated HNSCC. In the present study, we investigated the role of Caveolin-1 (Cav1) in the sensitivity of HNSCC cell lines to CTX-radiotherapy that might predict HNSCC relapse. Ctrl-and Cav-1-overexpressing HNSCC cell lines were exposed to solvent, CTX, or irradiation, or exposed to CTX before irradiation. Growth, clonogenicity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, metabolism and signaling pathways were analyzed. Cav1 expression was analyzed in 173 tumor samples and correlated to locoregional recurrence and overall survival. We showed that Cav1-overexpressing cells demonstrate better survival capacities and remain proliferative and motile when exposed to CTX-radiotherapy. Resistance is mediated by the Cav1/EREG/YAP axis. Patients whose tumors overexpressed Cav1 experienced regional recurrence a few years after adjuvant radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy. Together, our observations suggest that a high expression of Cav1 might be predictive of locoregional relapse of LA-HNSCC.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Abundance and signaling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are not only genetically determined but are also subject to the traits of the tumor microenvironment, which has hitherto not been clarified completely. We investigated the impact of hypoxia on the EGFR system and on PD-L1 in six HPV negative HNSCC cell lines in vitro and in FaDu xenografts in vivo. Protein levels of EGFR, AKT, pAKT, ERK1/2, pERK1/2, CA IX, cleaved PARP (apoptosis), LC3B (autophagy), and PD-L1 were quantified by western blot after oxygen deprivation or CoCl2, staurosporine, and erlotinib treatment. In FaDu xenograft tumors the expression of EGFR, CA IX andCD34 staining were analyzed. Reduced oxygen supply strongly downregulated EGFR protein levels and signaling in FaDu cells in vitro and in vivo, and a transient downregulation of EGFR signaling was found in three other HNSCC cell lines. PD-L1 was affected by oxygen deprivation in only one HNSCC cell line showing increased protein amounts. The results of this study indicate a significant impact of the traits of the tumor microenvironment on crucial molecular targets of cancer therapies with high clinical relevance for therapy resistance and response in HNSCC.© Copyright © 2021 Zahnreich, Gebrekidan, Multhoff, Vaupel, Schmidberger and Mayer.

AB  - Cervical cancer (CC) arises from premalignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) induced by a persistent infection with human papillomaviruses. The multi-stepwise disease progression is driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Our previous studies demonstrated a clear downregulation of inter-alpha-trypsin-inhibitor-heavy chain 5 (ITIH5) at mRNA and protein levels in CC compared to CIN2/3 and normal cervical tissue. Initial in vitro functional analyses revealed a suppressive effect of ITIH5 on relevant mechanisms for cancer progression in conventional two dimensional (2D) cell culture model systems. Based on these studies, we aimed to investigate the functional relevance of ITIH5 in multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) models, which resemble in vivo tumors more closely. We successfully established CC cell line-derived MCTS using the hanging-drop technique. ITIH5 was ectopically overexpressed in HeLa and SiHa cells and its functional relevance was investigated under three dimensional (3D) culture conditions. We found that ITIH5 re-expression significantly suppressed tumor spheroid growth and spheroid invasiveness of both HeLa and SiHa spheroids. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses revealed a significant reduction in Ki-67 cell proliferation index and CAIX-positive areas indicative for hypoxia and acidification. Furthermore, we observed an increase in cPARP-positive cells suggesting a higher rate of apoptosis upon ITIH5 overexpression. An effect of ITIH5 expression on the susceptibility of cervical MCTS towards cytostatic drug treatment was not observed. Collectively, these data uncover pronounced anti-proliferative effects of ITIH5 under 3D cell culture conditions and provide further functional evidence that the downregulation of ITIH5 expression during cervical carcinogenesis could support cancer development.Copyright © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Background: Nutritional support, including nutritional counseling and oral nutritional supplements (ONSs), has been recommended at the earliest opportunity in head and neck (H&N) cancer patients. The limited available evidence on the efficacy of immunonutrition during chemoradiotherapy (CT-RT) in H&N cancer patients is positive with regard to some secondary endpoints, but is still scanty, particularly with regard to toxicity and treatment tolerance. We hypothesize that early systematic provision of ONSs with a high-protein-high-calorie mixture containing immunonutrients (Impact) compared to standard high-calorie-high-protein nutritional blends, in addition to nutritional counseling, may be beneficial to patients with H&N cancer during CT-RT. Hence, we designed the present study to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of treatment tolerance, toxicity and response, body weight, body composition, protein-calorie intake, quality of life (QoL), fatigue, muscle strength and immunological profile of the early systematic provision of ONSs enriched in immunonutrients compared to isonitrogenous standard blends, in H&N cancer patients undergoing CT-RT. Method(s): This is a pragmatic, bicentric, randomized (1:1), parallel-group, open label, controlled, pilot clinical trial. Discussion(s): Many efforts are still to be taken to improve the efficacy of nutritional support in oncology. Immunonutrition represents a promising approach also in H&N cancer patients, but the evidence on its efficacy in improving clinical outcomes during CT-RT is still inconclusive. The present pilot study, which guarantees the early provision of nutritional assessment and support to all the enrolled patients in accordance with the recent guidelines and recommendations, could represent one of the first proofs of the clinical effectiveness of early oral immunonutrition in cancer patients undergoing CT-RT and could stimulate further large randomized trials, potentially resulting in the improvement of supportive care quality.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus virus (HPV) plays an important role in some human malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, it is necessary to evaluate the role of carcinogenic agents in local settings as well. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the frequency of HPV genotypes in head and neck epithelial cancers. Method(s): In this case-control study, 202 patients with suspected carcinoma referred to Shafa Hospital (Kerman, Iran, 2017) for pathological evaluation were enrolled. A definitive diagnosis of carcinoma was reported for 101 patients (case group) and in the other 101 subjects, carcinoma was not diagnosed. In order to determine the presence and type of HPV in tissue samples, the PCR method was used. Data analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, independent t-test, and logistic regression. Result(s): In total, 27 head and neck SCC samples (26.7%) were positive for HPV DNA. In addition, the virus species were HPV-11 in 15 cases (14.9%), HPV-16 and HPV-18 in 12 cases (11.9%), and HPV-6 in 10 cases (9.9%). According to the results, the presence of HPV was significantly higher in patients with SCC (P < 0.001). Moreover, smoking (P = 0.03) and opioid use (P < 0.001) were also significantly associated with SCC. Conclusion(s): The results of the present study demonstrated the presence of HPV in tissue samples of head and neck SCC patients in Kerman, Iran. Further studies are needed to investigate the preventive role of HPV vaccination in head and neck SCC.Copyright © 2021, Kerman University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining illness, and HIV-positive women are at high risk. The present study aimed to determine the magnitude of the problem, compare the performance of screening tests and assess factors affecting participation. Method(s): HIV-positive women aged 30-59 years attend the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics were screened by conventional Pap, HPV testing (Hybrid Capture 2) and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). A cohort of HIV-negative women from the community matched for age and parity were screened similarly. Screen-positive women underwent colposcopy and biopsy. Factors affecting participation were assessed. Result(s): Pap, VIA and HPV were positive in 48 (23.8%), 65 (32.2%) and 76 (37.6%) subjects, respectively, among HIV-positive women, and in 12 (5.9%), 10 (4.9%) and 12 (5.9%) subjects, respectively, among HIV-negative women. CIN2 + was present in 12 (6.4%) HIV-positive women and in 1(0.5%) HIV-negative woman (p = < 0.004). Sensitivity of HPV, Pap and VIA for detection of CIN2 + lesions was 91.7%, 75.0% and 75.0%, respectively; specificity was 68.4%, 83.9% and 72.5%, respectively. Lack of availability of screening facilities in the ART clinic and long waiting times were a strong deterrent to participation among HIV-positive women. Conclusion(s): There was higher prevalence of HPV infection and CIN2 + lesions in HIV-positive women. VIA showed equivalent sensitivity to Pap and could be a good substitute in low resource settings. Setting up cervical screening services in ART clinics and sensitising physicians can improve outcomes among these women.Copyright © 2021, Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India.

AB  - Several human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with the development of cervical carcinoma. HPV DNA synthesis is increased during the differentiation of infected host keratinocytes as they migrate from the basal layer of the epithelium to the spinous layer, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Nucleosome positioning affects various cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair by permitting the access of transcription factors to promoters to initiate transcription. In this study, nucleosome positioning on virus chromatin was investigated in normal immortalized keratinocytes (NIKS) stably transfected with HPV16 or HPV18 genomes to determine if there is an association with the viral life cycle. Micrococcal nuclease-treated DNA analyzed by Southern blotting using probes against HPV16 and HPV18 and quantified by nucleosome scanning analysis using real-time PCR revealed mononucleosomal-sized fragments of 140-200 base pairs that varied in their location within the viral genome according to whether the cells were undergoing proliferation or differentiation. Notably, changes in the regions around nucleotide 110 in proliferating and differentiating host cells were common to HPV16 and HPV18. Our findings suggest that changes in nucleosome positions on viral DNA during host cell differentiation is an important regulatory event in the viral life cycle.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Various etiological factors have been described in laryngeal carcinogenesis. Tobacco and alcohol play a major role in the development of laryngeal cancers. However, recently there has been an overshadowing of association of human papillomavirus infection in laryngeal cancers. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in malignant laryngeal lesions. This is a case control study. We conducted this study using tumor tissue specimens from 30 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients and benign laryngeal tissue specimens from 30 cancer-free controls. The specimens from the lesion were sent to histopathological analysis as well as DNA extraction (DNeasy(R) Tissue kit) and polymerase chain reaction for detection of HPV. Positive samples underwent sequencing to detect the HPV serotype. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. All 30 benign laryngeal lesion specimens were negative for the HPV DNA, while 4 of the 30 (7.5%) squamous cell carcinoma lesions were positive. One was HPV 16 and another one HPV 11. Two positive cases were not able to be sequenced probably due to low viral load. Our study suggests that the proportion of laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas attributable to infection by HPV seems to be low. Further prospective studies should be conducted with a larger group of patients to confirm the role of HPV in laryngeal cancers especially in treatment response and survival.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) are the most common histological types of cervical cancer (CC). The worse prognosis of ADC cases highlights the need for better molecular characterization regarding differences between these CC types. RNA-Seq analysis of seven SCC and three ADC human papillomavirus 16-positive samples and the comparison with public data from non-tumoral human papillomavirus-negative cervical tissue samples revealed pathways exclusive to each histological type, such as the epithelial maintenance in SCC and the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathway in ADC. The transcriptional regulatory network analysis of cervical SCC samples unveiled a set of six transcription factor (TF) genes with the potential to positively regulate long non-coding RNA genes DSG1-AS1, CALML3-AS1, IGFL2-AS1, and TINCR. Additional analysis revealed a set of MODY TFs regulated in the sequence predicted to be repressed by miR-96-5p or miR-28-3p in ADC. These microRNAs were previously described to target LINC02381, which was predicted to be positively regulated by two MODY TFs upregulated in cervical ADC. Therefore, we hypothesize LINC02381 might act by decreasing the levels of miR-96-5p and miR-28-3p, promoting the MODY activation in cervical ADC. The novel TF networks here described should be explored for the development of more efficient diagnostic tools.© Copyright © 2021 Bispo, Farias, de Araujo-Souza, Cintra, Santos, Jorge, Castro, Wajnberg, Scherer, Genta, Carvalho, Villa, Sichero and Passetti.

AB  - Sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) is a rare benign tumor of the salivary glands, and only 3 unequivocal cases of SP arising in the bronchus have been reported. We herein describe the histomorphologic and molecular features of 4 bronchial SP cases and discuss the differential diagnosis of this entity and the relationship with its clinicopathologic mimics, in particular, glandular papilloma and mixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma (GP/MP). We encountered 2 male and 2 female patients with bronchial SP (mean: 66.8 y old). All 4 tumors arose in the central bronchus and were characterized by a combination of surface exophytic endobronchial papillary proliferation and a submucosal multicystic component with complex architecture. The neoplastic epithelium consisted predominantly of nonciliated stratified columnar cells with ciliated, squamous, and mucinous cells present focally. While 2 tumors (50%) harbored a BRAF V600E mutation by molecular and immunohistochemical analysis, similar to GP/MP, no KRAS, HRAS, AKT1, or PIK3CA mutations were detected in any of the cases. Two patients were treated with limited resection, while 2 patients underwent lobectomy based on the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or possible squamous cell carcinoma in situ in the preoperative biopsy. All survived without recurrence or metastasis for 23 to 122 months after treatment. SP can develop in the central bronchus as the bronchial counterpart of the salivary gland tumor and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of endobronchial tumors. In addition, some histologic resemblance and frequent BRAF V600E mutation raise the possibility of SP and GP/MP being on the same disease spectrum.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Various types of human cancers were characterized by an altered expression of epithelial or stromal caveolin-1 (CAV1). However, the clinical significance of CAV1 expression in penile cancer remains largely unknown. Here the expression patterns of CAV1 were analyzed in a retrospective cohort (n=43) of penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Upon penile cancer progression, significantly increased CAV1-levels were determined within the malignant epithelium, whereas within the tumor stroma, namely the fibroblastic tumor compartment harboring activated and/or cancer associated fibroblasts, CAV1 levels significantly decline. Concerning the clinicopathological significance of CAV1 expression in penile cancer as well as respective epithelial-stromal CAV1 distributions, high expression within the tumor cells as well as low expression of CAV1 within the stromal compartment were correlated with decreased overall survival of penile cancer patients. Herein, CAV1 expressions and distributions at advanced penile cancer stages were independent of the immunohistochemically proven tumor protein p53 status. In contrast, less differentiated p16-positive tumor epithelia (indicative for human papilloma virus infection) were characterized by significantly decreased CAV1 levels. Conclusively, we provide further and new evidence that the characteristic shift in stromal-epithelial CAV1 being functionally relevant to tumor progression even occurs in penile SCC.© Copyright © 2021 Panic, Reis, Wittka, Darr, Hadaschik, Jendrossek and Klein.

AB  - Infection with specific pathogens and alterations in tissue commensal microbial composition are intricately associated with the development of many human cancers. Likewise, dysbiosis of oral microbiome was also shown to play critical role in the initiation as well as progression of oral cancer. However, there are no reports portraying changes in oral microbial community in the patients of Indian subcontinent, which has the highest incidence of oral cancer per year, globally. To establish the association of bacterial dysbiosis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) among the Indian population, malignant lesions and anatomically matched adjacent normal tissues were obtained from fifty well-differentiated OSCC patients and analyzed using 16S rRNA V3-V4 amplicon based sequencing on the MiSeq platform. Interestingly, in contrast to the previous studies, a significantly lower bacterial diversity was observed in the malignant samples as compared to the normal counterpart. Overall our study identified Prevotella, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Deinococcus and Noviherbaspirillum as significantly enriched genera, whereas genera including Actinomyces, Sutterella, Stenotrophomonas, Anoxybacillus, and Serratia were notably decreased in the OSCC lesions. Moreover, we demonstrated HPV-16 but not HPV-18 was significantly associated with the OSCC development. In future, with additional validation, this panel could directly be applied into clinical diagnostic and prognostic workflows for OSCC in Indian scenario.© Copyright © 2021 Sarkar, Malik, Laha, Das, Bunk, Ray, Chatterjee and Saha.

AB  - Objectives To increase effectiveness of the cervical cancer screening program, self-sampling can be an option. Both self-collected vaginal samples (SCV) and urine samples may be useful alternatives to clinician-taken cervical samples (CS). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Colposcopy clinic. Participants Women (n=305) referred to colposcopy after abnormal cervical screening result or conditions like postcoital bleeding. Intervention All women self-collected a urine and a vaginal sample prior to colposcopy, where a CS and biopsies were taken. All samples were tested for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) using the Cobas HPV assay. The gold standard was histology diagnoses (CIN2+/CIN3+) from biopsies obtained at the same examination. Primary outcome Absolute and relative sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing on SCV and urine to detect CIN2+/CIN3+ compared with the CS. Secondary outcome The acceptability by women of self-sampling. Results Both the vaginal and urine sample were comparable to the CS in identifying severe intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+/CIN3+). Absolute sensitivity ranged from 93% for urine samples to 96% for SCV for detecting CIN2+, which is comparable to the sensitivity of CS (overlapping 95% CI). The relative sensitivity for detecting CIN2+ was 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.04) for SCV and 0.96 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) for urine samples. At CIN3+, the relative sensitivity was 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.08) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.07) for SCV and urine samples, respectively. There were no statistical differences between the self-collected samples and the CS (McNemar's test >0.05). The relative specificity was also similar (1.03 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.12) for SCV and 0.98 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.09) for urine samples) (McNemar's test >0.05). The acceptability of self-sampling was evaluated by questionnaire. The women found the instructions on sample collection easy to understand and were positive about self-sampling with a preference for the urine sample. Conclusion Self-sampling by SCV and urine is a clinically safe alternative to CS with a high degree of acceptability.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Objective: To determine the risk group of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix that will resist to treatment before concomitant chemoradiotherapy and who will develop metastasis via fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) metabolic data. Subjects and Methods: Fifty two patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix who were treated in our clinic between 2015-2018 were evaluated. The presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) from the first paraffin blocks diagnosed in all patients has been tested with real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients received brachytherapy after concomittant chemotherapy with external radiotherapy. The first18F-FDGPET/CT and magnetic resonance images (MRI) images obtained for pretreatment staging and MRI after external radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. The patients who resisted conco- mittant chemoradiotherapy were tried and determined with pre-treatment18F-FDGPET/CT metabolic data. Result(s): The follow-up period of our patients with an average age of 53 years (42.5-60.75) was 53.5 months (42.5-60.75). Radiotherapy with a total median dose of 85 EqD2 (84-86) was delivered to all patients. The heterogeneity factor (HF) was found to be statistically significantly lower in patients in whom complete response was obtained after external radiotherapy in MRI (P=0.049). Any statistically significant difference was not found between groups of patients who did, and did not develop metastases as for primary tumor standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) values. In patients without metastasis, heterogeneity factor (HF) was found to be statistically significantly lower than those who developed metastasis (P=0.026). Conclusion(s): It is possible to predict poor prognostic patients with the help of HF, although we could not predict the resistant patients to treatment of primary tumor.Copyright © 2021 P.Ziti and Co.

AB  - PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) is extremely radiosensitive. Radiation therapy plus high-dose cisplatin remains the standard of care but causes long-term toxicity. Treatment deintensification approaches that reduce toxicity while maintaining survival are desirable for HPV-related OPSCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 trial. Patients with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, American Joint Committee on Cancer (seventh edition) stage III or IV OPSCC positive for both p16 and HPV DNA were eligible. Patients with T4, N3, or T1N1 disease were excluded. Smoking history was not included in eligibility criteria. Patients received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of 70 Gy in 35 fractions or 70.4 Gy in 32 fractions without chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was complete response or complete metabolic response 10 weeks after IMRT completion. RESULTS: Between September 13, 2013, and November 15, 2016, 39 patients were enrolled according to a 2-stage Simon design. Twenty-three patients (59%) had smoked for more than10 pack-years. Thirty-six patients (92%) had tumors genotyped as HPV16. Thirty-seven patients (95%) received full-dose radiation therapy and 35 (90%) had complete response or complete metabolic response. Median follow-up was 51 months (interquartile range, 41-63 months). One patient (3%) had regional recurrence and 3 (8%) had distant metastasis. One patient died of disease. The 2-year progression-free survival rate was 94% (95% CI, 81%-99%), and the 2-year overall survival rate was 100%. Common grade 3 adverse events during IMRT included mucositis in 10 patients (26%) and dysphagia in 7 patients (18%). No patients were dependent on a feeding tube at 1 month after IMRT completion. No grade 3 or 4 late adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT alone is associated with excellent response as well as reduced toxicity and could be a treatment option for carefully selected patients with locally advanced "true" HPV-related OPSCC. Further studies are warranted.

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is characterized by increased genetic instability as an essential variable of event of neoplastic transformation. The aim of this study was to evaluate genomic instability in exfoliated cells from the buccal mucosa of patients with OSCC vs. the control group, using DNA Breakage Detection/Fluorescence In Situ hybridization (DBD-FISH). Exfoliated cells from the buccal mucosa were obtained from 38 patients with oral cancer (case group) and from 10 individuals without oral lesions (control group). DNA damage was evaluated by DBD-FISH using the whole-genome DNA probe and digital imaging analysis. Collaterally, HPV infection was determined utilizing the INNO-LiPA HPV kit. Patients with OSCC showed an increase in the hybridization signal five times more intense than that of the baseline level of DNA damage detected in control individuals. The best cutoff value for predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma was 67.46, and an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 87. HPV detection analysis revealed than one patient with OSCC (2.6%) was positive for HPV. All controls were negative HPV. In conclusion, DBD-FISH permitted the clear visualization of level high of DNA damage in the buccal epithelial cells of patients with OSSC respect to control group. Chromosome instability in oral mucosa may be an individual marker of malignant transformation in OSCC.

AB  - Background: Evaluation of possibilities offered by PET/MRI in GTV definition of primary tumors during radiotherapy planning in patients (pts) with locally advanced carcinoma of the oral cavity and the oropharynx. Method(s): 15 pts with SCC of the oral cavity and the oropharynx underwent CECT (Aquilion ONE, Toshiba) and PET/MRI (3T Siemens Biograph mMRI) examination. Delineation of GTV was done using two methods: visual interpretation of CT (GTV-CT), PET (GTV-PETvis) and MRI (GTV-MRI) images, as well as the quantitative automatic method (Syngovia, Siemens) based on a selected threshold value (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) of SUVmax from a PET examination (GTV-PET20%, GTV-PET30%, etc). Obtained volumes were compared and differences were statistically analysed. Result(s): Statistical analysis demonstrated that GTV-MRI (p=0.0010), GTV-PET20% (p=0.0409), GTV-PET40% (p=0.0309) and GTV-PET50% (p=0.0018) diverged significantly from GTV-CT. The remaining measurements were not significantly different from GTV-CT. 73% of GTV-PETvis were inside the GTV-MRI contours. 27% of increased FDG uptake was present outside the GTV-MRI boundaries. Conclusion(s): Hybrid PET/MRI may provide improved accuracy in radiotherapy planning since it can identify regions of the tumor which are not clearly visible in other examinations. GTV-MRI, GTV-PET20%, GTV-PET40% and GTV-PET50% diverge significantly from GTV-CT.Copyright © Oncology and Radiotherapy.

AB  - Trans-resveratrol (RES) exhibits a wide range of biological activities. Various methodological approaches have been established to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of RES. Moreover, additional in vivo studies are required to support clinical application. In this study, RES/HP-beta-CD (RHSD) inclusion complex was prepared and characterized by FTIR, PXRD, DSC and NMR data. The effect and potential mechanism of RHSD against cervical cancer were investigated in a mouse xenograft tumor model by qPCR assay, Western blot assay, and immunohistochemical assay. Results showed that RHSD significantly decreased tumor growth compared with free RES, while the effect of preventing tumor growth was more prominent in vivo. Notably, RHSD could inhibit tumor development by suppressing the expression of HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes and upregulating P53 and Rb1 protein in cervical cancer. These findings demonstrated that RHSD was safe and potential for development of a new oral administration drug to treat cervical cancer.© Copyright © 2021 Hao, Sun, Zhu, Xie, Wang, Jiang, Fu and Sang.

AB  - Objective The objective of the present study was to assess the prevalence and type-specific distribution of cervical high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) among women with normal and abnormal cytology, and to describe risk factors for HR HPV among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Tanzania. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted in existing cervical cancer screening clinics in Kilimanjaro and Dar es Salaam. Cervical specimens were obtained from women aged 25-60 years. Samples were shipped to Denmark for cytological examination, and to Germany for HR HPV testing (using Hybrid Capture 2) and genotyping (using LiPaExtra). Risk factors associated with HPV were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result Altogether, 4080 women were recruited with 3416 women contributing data for the present paper, including 609 HIV-positive women and 2807 HIV-negative women. The overall HR HPV prevalence was 18.9%, whereas the HR HPV prevalence in women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) was 92.7%. Among HPV-positive women with HSIL, HPV16 (32.5%) and HPV58 (19.3%) were the the most common types followed by HPV18 (16.7%) and HPV52 (16.7%). Factors associated with HR HPV included younger age, increasing number of partners and early age at first intercourse. Similar risk factors were found among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. In addition, among HIV-positive women, those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3 had an increased risk of HR HPV (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.8) compared with individuals with CD4 count >=500 cells/mm 3. Conclusion Given the HPV distribution among Tanzanian women, the current HPV vaccination in Tanzania using quadrivalent vaccine may be considered replaced by the nonavalent vaccine in the future. In addition, appropriate antiretroviral treatment management including monitoring of viremia may decrease the burden of HR HPV in HIV-positive women.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPV self-sampling has been widely supported by the scientific community following a strong body of literature on the subject. Self-sampling is important in cervical cancer screening as it has been shown to improve participation. It is well documented that HPV-testing has proven superior to cytology with regards to sensitivity in detection of CIN and cancer. The value of self-collected samples is reliant on the quality of the molecular testing performed, as well as the patients' preference in sampling procedure and compliance to follow up on positive test results. Due to the incompatibility of self-samples and cytology, triage of HPV-DNA positives by testing for molecular biomarkers is highly warranted. METHODS: Our objective was to compare the detection rate of genital Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection in self- and clinician-collected samples by a 14-type HPV-DNA test and a 7-type mRNA E6/E7 test. RESULTS: Five hundred five women were recruited. Each study participant had two sample collection procedures performed upon the same visit, alternating order in execution of the self-collection or the clinician-taken procedure first or second, 1010 samples in total. HPV-DNA prevalence was 22.8% in self-collected versus 19.2% in clinician-collected samples (P = 0.19). Overexpression of mRNA E6/E7 from 7 HPV types was 7.1 and 6.3%, respectively (P = 0.71). The difference between HPV-DNA and HPV-mRNA positivity rates were statistically significant in both self-collected (22.8% versus 7.1%, P < 0.001) and clinician-collected samples (19.2% versus 6.3%, P < 0.001). Overall agreement between the two collection methods was fair, with a concordance rate of 78.2% (390/505), k = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.25-0.44), P < 0.001, for the HPV-DNA test and 92.5% (467/505), k = 0.40 (95% CI, 0.25-0.56), P < 0.001, for the mRNA test, respectively. 96.8% of the participants reported they felt confident carrying out the self-collection themselves, and 88.8% reported no discomfort at all performing the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative study of two sampling methods reports fair agreement of HPV positivity rates between the self-collected and clinician-collected specimens using Abbott hrHPV and PreTect HPV-Proofer'7 tests. Only one third of HPV-DNA positive women had overexpression of mRNA E6/E7. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN77337300 .

AB  - Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy associated with high-risk Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Despite improved outcomes in non-metastatic ASCC, definitive chemoradiotherapy constitutes the standard treatment for localized disease. Evidences for predictive and prognostic biomarkers are limited. Here, we performed a viral, immune, and mutational characterization of 79 non-metastatic ASCC patients with complete definitive chemoradiotherapy. HPV-16 was detected in 91% of positive cases in single infections (78%) or in coinfections with multiple genotypes (22%). Fifty-four percent of non-metastatic ASCC cases displayed mutations affecting cancer driver genes such as PIK3CA (21% of cases), TP53 (15%), FBXW7 (9%), and APC (6%). PD-L1 expression was detected in 57% of non-metastatic ASCC. Increased PD-L1 positive cases (67%) were detected in patients with complete response compared with non-complete response to treatment (37%) (p = 0.021). Furthermore, patients with PD-L1 positive tumors were significantly associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with patients with PD-L1 negative tumors (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002, respectively). PD-L1 expression strongly impacts CR rate and survival of non-metastatic ASCC patients after standard definitive chemoradiotherapy. PD-L1 expression could be used to stratify good versus poor responders avoiding the associated morbidity with abdominal perineal resection.

AB  - Objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as the primary cervical cancer screening followed by reflex cytology if high-risk HPV is present (hrHPV+) is recently adopted in some countries. However, reflex cytology's sensitivity is variable, and a suitable triage approach for hrHPV+ remains controversial. Here, we compared the performance of three triage tools in hrHPV+ women. Method(s): Three triage tools-cytology, HPV16/18 genotyping, and DNA methylation biomarker PAX1m-were analyzed for their clinical performance in hrHPV+ women. In addition, women without cervical cancer at enrollment were followed for histologically confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN3+) annually using Papanicolaou smear. Result(s): Of 4762 women aged >=20 years enrolled, 502 (10.5%) were hrHPV+. PAX1m and cytology demonstrated similar accuracy (>90%), sensitivity (>78%), and specificity (>92%) as triage tools in 429 hrHPV+ women aged 30-64 years. PAX1m had better accuracy and specificity (91.6% and 92.5%, respectively) than HPV16/18 (76.9% and 76.8%, respectively). The incidence of CIN3+ among hrHPV+ women was 10.7 cases/1000 person-years. The incidence was significantly greater in PAX1m-positive women than in PAX1m-negative women. Conclusion(s): PAX1m has comparable clinical performance to cytology and better accuracy and specificity than HPV16/18 as the triage tool for detecting CIN3+ in hrHPV+ women. The PAX1m assay is thus a promising molecular-based triage tool for early detection of CIN and predicting disease progression in hrHPV+ women. It can be especially useful in countries where adequate cytology-based infrastructure is lacking, such as some Southeast Asian countries, for cervical cancer screening and prevention.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid is used to control the burden of cervical cancer in low- and middle-income countries. This method has some limitations and HPV DNA testing may be an alternative, but it is expensive and requires a laboratory setup. Cheaper and faster HPV tests have been developed. This study describe the agreement between a fast HPV test (careHPV) and hybrid capture 2 (HC2) in detection of high-risk HPV among Tanzanian women. Material(s) and Method(s): The study involved women attending routine cervical cancer screening at the Ocean Road Cancer Institute and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Tanzania. The women were offered HIV testing. Two cervical samples were subsequently obtained; the first sample was processed at the clinics using careHPV and the second sample was transported to Denmark and Germany for cytology and HC2 analysis. Kappa statistic was calculated to assess the agreement between careHPV and HC2. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of careHPV were calculated using HC2 as reference. The analyses were done for the overall study population and stratified by testing site and HIV status. Result(s): A total of 4080 women were enrolled, with 437 being excluded due to invalid information, lack of careHPV or HC2 results. Overall agreement between the tests was substantial with a kappa value of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.72). The sensitivity and specificity of careHPV was 90.7% (95% CI 89.6-91.8) and 84.2% (95% CI 81.2-86.8), respectively. The agreement was similar in the stratified analyses where the kappa values were 0.75 (95% CI 0.70-0.79) in women aged 25-34, 0.66 (95% CI 0.62-0.70) in women aged 35-60, 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.77) at the Ocean Road Cancer Institute, 0.64 (95% CI 0.60-0.69) at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, 0.73 (95% CI 0.68-0.79) in HIV-positive and 0.66 (95% CI 0.63-0.70) in HIV-negative women. The kappa value of 0.64 (95% CI 0.39-0.88) for cervical high-grade lesions indicates a substantial agreement between careHPV and HC2 in detecting HPV among women with cervical high-grade lesions. Conclusion(s): A substantial agreement was found between careHPV and HC2 in detecting HPV overall as well as detecting HPV among women with cervical high-grade lesions. However, given the limited resources available in low and middle-income countries, the HPV testing assay should be weighed against the cost-effectiveness of the test.Copyright © 2021 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology

AB  - Molecular screening programs for cervical cancer detect the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) in cell material or vaginal fluids. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is a necessary pre-requisite, but the majority of infections do not lead to pathological states. Additional biomarkers are needed to increase the specificity of the molecular tests. Here, we have investigated the possi-bility of detecting protein biomarkers using mass spectrometry from dried self-sampled cervico- vaginal fluid deposited on FTA cards. We found significant intra-individual correlations (p < 2.2 x 10-16 ), although heterogenous protein profiles were obtained between individuals. Out of 3699 proteins found in total, 169 were detected in at least 95% of the samples. Using a discovery/replication design, 18 proteins were found to be significant in the discovery cohort, with higher values in those cases compared to controls. All of these were found to also have higher levels among the cases in the replication cohort, with one protein (DEAD-Box Helicase) remaining statistically significant. Finally, a predictive 7-protein multivariate model was developed with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.55, respectively. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of protein biomarkers can be obtained from self-sampled dried CVF and that these could be used to predict cervical cancer pre-stages.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: High risk type 16 of human papillomavirus (HPV16) is associated with 50% of cervical cancer, for which reliable targeted therapies are lacking. HPV early protein 7 (E7) is an oncoprotein responsible for cell malignant transformation. In our previous work, a highly specific affibody targeting HPV16E7 (ZHPV16E7) was developed. Objective(s): In order to improve the targeted therapeutic effect, the present study prepared an affi-toxin consisting of ZHPV16E7 fused with granzyme B (GrB), namely, ZHPV16E7-GrB, and evaluated its targeting action in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): The ZHPV16E7-GrB fusion protein was produced in a prokaryotic expression system. The targeted binding properties of the ZHPV16E7-GrB to the HPV16E7 were confirmed by immunofluores-cence assay (IFA) in cervical cancer cell lines, by immunohistochemical assay (IHA) in cervical cancer tissue from clinical specimens and by near-infrared imaging in tumour-bearing mice. The an-ti-tumour effect on both cervical cancer cells in vitro and tumour-bearing mice in vivo were further evaluated. Result(s): A 34-kDa ZHPV16E7-GrB fusion protein was produced in E. coli and displayed the corre-sponding immunoreactivity. IFA revealed that ZHPV16E7-GrB bound specifically to HPV16-positive TC-1 and SiHa cells. IHA showed that ZHPV16E7-GrB also bound specifically to HPV16-positive clinical tissue specimens. In addition, the near-infrared imaging results showed that ZHPV16E7-GrB was enriched in tumour tissues. Moreover, both the ZHPV16E7-GrB affitoxin and ZHPV16E7 affibody (without GrB) significantly reduced the proliferation of cervical cancer cells in vitro and tumor-bearing mice in vivo, and the anti-proliferative effect of ZHPV16E7-GrB was higher than that of the ZHPV16E7 affi-body. Conclusion(s): The affitoxin by coupling the affibody with GrB is a promising targeted therapeutic agent with the dual advantages of the targeted affibody and the GrB cytotoxin.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction With the exception of breast cancer, gynecologic neoplasms constitute the most common cancers that complicate pregnancy. Pregnancy therefore presents a window of opportunity for all pregnant women who do not take part in routine free cervical cancer screening program to undergo a free voluntary cytological test and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. This study aimed to determine prevalent HPV genotypes among pregnant women using exfoliated cells from cervical swabs and determine risk factors responsible for the upsurge of cervical precancerous lesions. Methods In a cross-sectional study conducted from October 2017 to March 2018, a total of 482 pregnant women were enrolled. Cervical swabs and samples for cytology were collected from each enrolled participant during their routine prenatal consultation. The Papanicolaou's (Pap) staining technique was performed and all cervical swab samples were amplified through conventional PCR. HPV genotypes were identified using the Roche Linear Array Genotyping Assay. SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc., USA) was used for statistical analysis and p values <0.05 were considered significant. Results Among the 482 participants, 354 (73.4%) had normal cytology and 128 (26.6%) had abnormal cytology. HPV DNA was identified in 62/464 (13.4%). The most prominent HPV types identified were HPV 16 (24%), HPV 18 (36.4%), HPV 45 (28%), HPV 53 (18.9%) and HPV 67 (24.3%). Early intercourse, number of sexual partners and age at first pregnancy were some of the risk factors that influenced the etiology of preinvasive cervical lesion. Conclusions Prevalent HPV types identified in our study were HPV 16, 18, 45, 53 and 67. Organizing effective screening programs in prenatal care facilities is crucial in order to detect prevalent HR-HPV types and precursors for cervical lesions. The addition of HPV vaccination in the national immunization program with focus on the different epidemiological HPV genotypes circulating in the country is warranted.Copyright © GERMS 2021.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a radiomic MRI feature-based prediction model can differentiate oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) according to the human papillomavirus (HPV) status. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Pretreatment MRI data from 62 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal SCC were retrospectively reviewed, and chronologically allocated to training (n = 43) and test sets (n = 19). Enhancing tumors were semi-automatically segmented on each slice of the postcontrast T1WI to span the entire tumor volume, after registration of T2WI to postcontrast T1WI; 170 radiomic features were extracted from the entire tumor volume. Relevant features were selected and radiomics models were trained using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model with 10-fold cross-validation, after subsampling of training sets using synthetic minority over-sampling technique to mitigate data imbalance. The selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients, were combined linearly to yield a radiomics score. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic score was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Six radiomic features, which revealed strong association with HPV status of oropharyngeal SCC, were selected using LASSO. The radiomics model yielded excellent performance on the training set (AUC, 0.982 [95% CI, 0.942-1.000]) and moderate performance on the test set (AUC, 0.744 [95% CI, 0.496-0.991]) for differentiating oropharyngeal SCC according to HPV status. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics-based MRI phenotyping differentiates oropharyngeal SCC according to HPV status, and thus, is a potential imaging biomarker.

AB  - Background. South African women of reproductive age have a high burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, there is limited information on the prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens in women from rural Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The study aims at determining the prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens and co-infection with high-risk (HR) HPV among women from rural Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Methods. A total of 205 cervical specimens were collected from women aged >= 30 years from a rural community-based clinic. The samples were tested for a panel of pathogenic STIs [Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars A-K & L1-L3), Haemophilus ducreyi, Herpes Simplex Virus (Types 1 & 2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and pathobionts [Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Mycoplasma hominis (MH) and Ureaplasma spp. (UP)] using a multiplex PCR STD direct flow chip assay through a manual Hybrispot platform (Master Diagnostica, Granada, Spain). HR-HPV detection was performed by Hybrid Capture-2 assay. Results. High-risk HPV prevalence was 32.2% (66/205) and HIV-1 prevalence was 38.5% (79/205). The overall prevalence of six pathogenic STIs was 22.9% (47/205), with TV having the highest prevalence (15.6%; 32/205). UP (70.2%, 144/205) and MH (36.6%, 75/205) were the most frequently detected pathobionts. Co-infection with >=2 pathogens pathobionts was observed among 52.7% (108/205) participants. Of the six pathogenic STIs, three participants had more than one STI (1.46%) with the presence of MH and UP. HSV-2 (OR: 4.17, CI [1.184-14.690]) and HIV infection (OR: 2.11, CI [1.145-3.873]) were independent STIs associated with HR-HPV infection. Conclusions. The high prevalence of pathogenic STIs underscores the need to improve syndromic management policy by implementing effective strategies of prevention, screening tests, and management. HSV-2 and HIV positive remain strongly associated with HR-HPV infection.Copyright © 2021 Taku et al.

AB  - Objectives: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the main etiology of invasive cervical cancer. Together HPV and viral hepatitis account for the cause of 25% of cancers in developing countries. To evaluate the association between population movements and the spread of HPV, this study looked at prevalence, genotypes, and phylogenetic assessment of HPV in Great Khorasan, a pilgrimage-tourism province in northeast Iran. Method(s): From March 2013 to July 2018, 567 samples were collected from three groups in Khorasan: Razavi and North Khorasan provinces (highly mobile population); South Khorasan province (conservative and desert); and diverse group (tourists). Result(s): HPV prevalence was 48.4% in Razavi and North Khorasan (first group); 19.9% in South Khorasan (second group); and 33.6% in the diverse group. The four most common HPV genotypes were HPV-6, 11, 51 and 16, in the first group; HPV-6, 11, 16 and 58 in the second group; and HPV-6, 11, 16 and 53/89 in the diverse group. The most frequent genotypes that are known as high risk for cervical cancer were HPV-51 in the first group, HPV-16 in the second group and the diverse group. Among low-risk genotypes, HPV-6, and HPV-11 were more frequent in all groups. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 20 HPV-positive samples showed that the distributions of the HPV genotypes were HPV-6 (50%), 11 (10%), 67 (5%), 16 (15%), 31 (10%), 54 (5%), and 89 (5%). Conclusion(s): The findings show that areas associated with population movement should be frequently monitored for infectious diseases, while conservative and less populated areas have less risk for virus spread and endemicity. Health authorities should focus more on the establishment of HPV diagnostic facilities, screening, vaccination, and enhancement of public knowledge in these regions.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes adult-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (AORRP), but AORPP prevalence is much lower than HPV prevalence. Thus, HPV infection is necessary, but not sufficient, to cause AORRP and other factors likely contribute to its pathogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate whether co-infection with herpetic viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of AORRP. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study conducted from January 2018 to November 2019. SETTINGS: Tertiary referral centre. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen consecutive patients with AORRP and 18 adults with healthy laryngeal mucosa (control group) undergoing surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, human herpesvirus 6, varicella zoster virus and HPV (including genotyping) were detected in biopsies of papilloma or healthy mucosa using real-time polymerase chain reaction and reverse line blot. Dysplasia and Ki67 levels were determined in papilloma specimens. RESULTS: EBV was present in 6 (33.3%) AORRP patients and no control patients (P = .019). Presence was not dependent on tobacco exposure (P = .413) or HPV genotype or concentration (P > .999). EBV presence was strongly related to increased cell proliferation (P = .005) and number of previous surgeries (P = .039), but not dysplasia (P > .999). Human herpesvirus 6 was found in 3 (16.7%) AORRP biopsies, with one false positive. No other herpetic virus was found. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other herpetic viruses, EBV seems to interact with HPV, enhancing cell proliferation and contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of AORRP. Further research is required to elucidate specific interactions and their role in the pathogenesis of AORRP.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor, and most human MCC cases are infected by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). However, the underlying pathogeneses of MCC in animals remain unclear. In the present study, newly established cell lines from feline and canine MCC, a MCPyV-positive human MCC cell line, and MCC tissues from 25 cats and 1 dog were examined and compared pathologically. Feline and canine MCCs were composed of tumor cells arranged in trabeculae and solid packets. Twenty out of 25 feline MCC cases (80%) had other proliferative cutaneous lesions, such as carcinoma in situ and squamous cell carcinoma. Among the 25 feline MCC cases, tumor cells were immunopositive for cytokeratins (CKs), including CK5/6 (4/25 cases, 16%), CK7 (5, 20%), CK18 (25, 100%), CK19 (20, 80%), and CK20 (20, 80%). The tumor cells of feline MCC were also immunopositive for synaptophysin (24/25, 96%) and CD56 (22/25, 88%). The tumor cells of canine MCC were immunopositive for CK18, CK19, CK20, and synaptophysin. Cultured feline and canine MCC cells grew in adherent monolayers and exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for CKs, whereas human MCC cells grew in suspension and exhibited dot-like cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for CKs. Differences in the distribution of CKs between human and animal MCC may be attributed to cell adhesion propensities. MCPyV genes and antigen were not detected in feline or canine MCC, suggesting a different etiology from human MCC.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular drivers of human papillomavirus-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV + HNSCC) are not entirely understood. This study evaluated the relationship between HPV integration, expression of E6/E7, and patient outcomes in p16+ HNSCCs. METHODS: HPV type was determined by HPV PCR-MassArray, and integration was called using detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We investigated whether fusion transcripts were produced by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). E6/E7 expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. We assessed if there was a relationship between integration and E6/E7 expression, clinical variables, or patient outcomes. RESULTS: Most samples demonstrated HPV integration, which sometimes resulted in a fusion transcript. HPV integration was positively correlated with age at diagnosis and E6/E7 expression. There was a significant difference in survival between patients with vs without integration. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous reports, HPV integration was associated with improved patient survival. Therefore, HPV integration may act as a molecular marker of good prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women. High-Risk HPV types are known as the main agents involved in genital and cervical malignancies. There may be co pathogens like STIs that are involved in enhancing the susceptibility and progression to cervical neoplasia. This study was conducted to detect C. trachomatis, HSV-2 and M. genitalium using qPCR in women suffering from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, HPV infection and non cancerous- non HPV subjects for the association of burden of genital disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive study was performed on 195 Liquid Based Cytology (LBCs) specimens collected from women referred to private laboratories. Fifty, 98 and 47 samples were from women with known CIN, HPV positive and non-cancerous/non-HPV, respectively. HSV-2, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium and HPV genotypes have been detected using multiplex TaqMan Real Time PCR and PCR hybridization. RESULTS: A total of 148 HPV positive samples were included. HPVs 6 (35.13%), 16 (32.43%), 18 (21.62%), 11 (9.46%), 31 (9.46%), and 51 (9.46%) were the most common genotypes. Single, 2, 3, and more than 4 multiple HPV genotypes were detected in 46%, 29.7%, 14.2%, 10.1% cases, respectively. The prevalence of M. genitalium, C. trachomatis and HSV2 was 3 (1.54%), 24 (12.3%) and 1(0.5%), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between these pathogens and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (p>/= 0.05). CONCLUSION: HR-HPV genotypes were more prevalent in genital infections and cervical cancer. It would seem early detection of dominant STI pathogens such as Chlamydia spp. gains due to effective prevention. Here, further research is needed to understand the co-infections burden of HPV genotypes with STIs in clinical manifestations.

AB  - Background: Anti-PD(L)1 agents have activity in HPV-associated cancers (HAC), with median overall survival (mOS) of <=12 months (mos). HPV infection has been linked to upregulation of tumor TGF-beta signaling. Bintrafusp alfa is a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the TGF-betaRII receptor (a TGF-beta "trap") fused to a human IgG1 mAb blocking PD-L1. Previously we reported a post hoc pooled analysis of pts with HAC treated with bintrafusp alfa. Here we report longer follow-up of additional pts with HAC pooled from phase (Ph) 1 (INTR@PID 001; NCT02517398) and Ph 2 (study 012; NCT03427411) studies. Method(s): Pts with advanced, pretreated, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-naive HAC who had exhausted standard-of-care treatment received bintrafusp alfa 0.3-30 mg/kg (Ph 1 dose escalation) or 1200 mg Q2W (Ph 1 expansion/Ph 2) until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Treatment past progression was allowed. Primary endpoints were safety (Ph 1 dose escalation) and best overall response per RECIST v1.1 (Ph 1 expansion/Ph 2). Result(s): As of 15 May 2020 (Ph 1) and 22 December 2020 (Ph 2), 75 pts with pretreated HAC (cervical 39, SCCHN 19, anal 9, other 8) had received bintrafusp alfa for a median duration of 3.2 mos (range, 0.5-29.9 mos) and been followed for a median of 33 mos; 3 pts remained on treatment. ORR was 28.0% [4 CRs; 17 PRs]; 3 more pts had a delayed PR, for a clinical response rate (RECIST response + delayed response) of 32.0%. Responses occurred in various HAC. Median duration of response (mDOR) was 17.3 (95% CI, 7.8-NE) mos. Median OS was 21.3 (95% CI, 10.8-NE) mos; 12- and 18-mo OS rates were 59.7% and 51.5%, respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were pruritus (25.3%, all events grade 1), dermatitis acneiform (24.0%, all grade 1), and anaemia (18.7%, grade 3 [6.7%]); no deaths due to TRAEs were observed. Conclusion(s): Bintrafusp alfa showed long-term efficacy (mDOR 17.3 mos, mOS 21.3 mos) and a manageable safety profile in pts with pretreated, ICI-naive HAC, a pt population with a high unmet need. Clinical trials of bintrafusp alfa in HAC are ongoing. Clinical trial identification: INTR@PID 001: NCT02517398; Study 012: NCT03427411.

AB  - Introduction In a functional immune system HLA-molecules are able to present antigens to immune cells. Because of peptide restriction in HLA-class I-molecules, antigen presentation is depending on the individual HLA-Allele composition. Therefore, antitumor immunity and tumor development are, among other factors, also dependent on the patient's HLA-genotype. The aim of this study was to analyse the different HLA-Allele frequencies between HNSCC patients and a healthy control and between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC patients, respectively. Material and Methods Hiqh resolution sequencing was performed on 150 HNSCC patients. The HLA-frequencies of the control group were taken from a public accessible HLA-database which included HLA data from 39639 German patients. To analyse the different HLA-Allele frequencies between the mentioned groups, qui square test and with frequencies under 5 exact fisher test was performed. Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli was used to correct for multiple testing. ResultsOur data showed significant increased frequencies of HLA-A*66:01 in HNSCC patients in comparison to the control group. Furthermore the analysis of the HLA alleles dependent on the HPV status showed a significant increase of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in HPV-positive HNSCC and HLA-B*08:01 in HPV-negative HNSCC. Discussion The results indicate a possible predisposition to developing head neck cancer and HPV-positive HNSCC, respectively. A possible explanation could be a limited presentation of tumor specific antigens (Immune gap) caused by the mentioned HLA-Alleles and therefore "a missing out" of the tumor.

AB  - Background and objective: COX2, an enzyme that metabolizes arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), contributes to the development of cervical dysplasia and cancer by inhibiting the immune response in the tumor micro-environment, as well as promoting cell proliferation, angiogenesis and invasiveness. Little is known about the changes induced by the tumor and its micro-environment on circulating immune cells. We evaluated the relative baseline expression of COX2 by circulating immune cell types and whether it is different in patients with cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer compared to normal controls. Method(s): Forty three patients were included: controls (n = 9), low grade dysplasia (CIN I, n = 13), high grade dysplasia (CIN ll-lll, n = 14), and invasive cervical cancer (n = 7) based on histopathology. Granulocytes, monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation (GE Healthcare, (Uppsala, Sweden)) followed by negative selection with MACS Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA) anti-biotinylated microbeads, total RNA isolated (QIAGEN RNeasy (Germantown, MD)) and COX2 mRNA expression evaluated with reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) normalized to GAPDH levels. Serum and plasma PGE2 levels were quantified by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) (R&D Systems (Mineappolis, MN)). Result(s): There were marked differences in COX2 expression between the various cell types (p <0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis) with granulocytes producing the highest levels, comparable to GAPDH (1.56 +/- 1.46), monocytes an intermediate amount (0.083 +/- 0.086), and B and T cells very small amounts (0.033 +/- 0.108 and 0.017 +/- 0.079 respectively). There was no significant difference in COX2 expression by disease state. B and T cells trended toward significance (p 0.055 and p 0.08 respectively) with the relative expression of COX2 increasing with disease severity. The importance of this is not clear given the very low levels of expression. Plasma PGE2 levels differed significantly by disease state (p 0.0014) with mean levels of controls: 1083 +/- 722 pg/mL, low grade: 1208 +/- 576 pg/mL, and high grade: 1415 +/-2127 pg/mL. Surprisingly, levels in patients with invasive cancer were low, 464 +/- 182 pg/mL. Discussion(s): This is the first exhaustive study of baseline COX2 expression in circulating immune cell types in any HPV-associated disease to the authors' knowledge. We have previously reported that circulating monocytes from patients with HPV-induced premalignant upper airway lesions show altered immune functions in response to stimuli compared to monocytes from normal controls. Future studies are necessary to determine whether circulating immune cells from patients with cervical dysplasia and cancer show pro-tumorigenic or immune down-regulating activity in response to stimuli.

AB  - The clinical performance evaluation of the novel MassARRAY human papillomavirus (MA-HPV) assay was performed using Danish SurePath cervical cancer screening samples under the fourth Validation of HPV Genotyping Tests (VALGENT) framework. The MA-HPV assay is a mass array-based assay that individually detects 14 oncogenic HPV genotypes and five nononcogenic types. The MA-HPV assay was validated using the VALGENT4 panel, which constitutes 997 consecutive samples from a screening population in addition to 297 disease-enriched samples with abnormal cytology findings. The clinical accuracy of the MA-HPV assay for sensitivity and specificity was assessed relative to that of the general primer 5+/6+ PCR enzyme immunoassay (GP-EIA), by a noninferiority test. The type-specific concordance of the MA-HPV assay was assessed as well. The relative sensitivity of the MA-HPV assay for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia >=2 or >=3 was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.98-1.05) and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.04), respectively. The sensitivity of the MA-HPV was noninferior to that of the GP-EIA (P = 0.0001), whereas the specificity of the MA-HPV was inferior (0.89; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91; P > 0.99). The MA-HPV assay is a clinical sensitive assay with a lower clinical specificity compared with the GP-EIA. The assay in its current form seems more suited to play a role where specificity is of lesser importance but where high sensitivity is paramount.Copyright © 2022 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology

AB  - Patients diagnosed with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ((L-SIL) or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) are subjected to additional investigations, such as colposcopy and biopsy, to rule out cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN 2+). Especially in young patients, lesions tend to regress spontaneously, and many human papilloma virus (HPV) infections are transient. Dual-staining p16/Ki-67 has been proposed for the triage of patients with ASC-US or L-SIL, but no prospective study addressing only this subgroup of patients has been con-ducted so far. We performed a prospective study including all eligible patients referred for a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Timisoara University City Hospital. HPV genotyping and dual-staining for p16/Ki-67 were performed prior to LEEP, at 6 and 12 months after LEEP. A total of 60 patients were included in the study and completed the follow-up evaluation. We analyzed the sensitivity and specificity for bi-opsy-confirmed CIN2+ using the 95% confidence interval (CI) of high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV), dual-staining p16/Ki-67, colposcopy, and combinations of the tests on all patients and separately for the ASC-US and L-SIL groups. Dual-staining p16/Ki-67 alone or in combination with HR-HPV and/or colposcopy showed a higher specificity that HR-HPV and/or colposcopy for the diagnosis of biopsy confirmed CIN2+ in patients under 30 years. Colposcopy + p16/Ki-67 and HR-HPV + colposcopy + p16/Ki-67 showed the highest specificity in our study.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Li-censee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Some studies have correlated secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) expression with more aggressive behavior in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We investigated the impact of SPARC expression on patient outcomes in a large cohort of SCCs. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with SCC were identified by searching institutional databases. A tissue microarray of paraffin-embedded tumor specimens was constructed, and SPARC immunohistochemistry was performed. Cellular and stromal SPARC expression were quantitated and correlated with clinicopathologic features. Result(s): Of 191 cases, 171 were adequate for SPARC evaluation. A total of 112 (65%) cases showed SPARC tumor cell staining, and 167 (98%) cases showed stromal staining. Increased SPARC stromal expression was correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) [mean (SD) survival, 64.3 (3.25) vs. 42.8 (3.25) mo; P = 0.0015] and poorer disease-specific survival (DSS) [mean (SD) survival, 51.1 (1.58) vs. 38.3 (1.832) mo; P = 0.0381]. Human papillomavirus-positive status correlated with both stromal and tumor SPARC expression (P = 0.0047 and 0.0408, respectively). SPARC staining did not correlate with OS or DSS in multivariate analyses. Among nonchemotherapy patients, SPARC stromal expression was associated with poorer OS and DSS (P = 0.0074 and 0.033, respectively). In multivariate analyses, increased stromal SPARC expression was associated with a longer disease-free interval [P = 0.0170 (hazard ratio, 1.384)]. Conclusion(s): SPARC expression is frequently present in tumoral stroma of head and neck SCCs. In contravention to prior studies, we found that SPARC expression did not correlate with survival overall. This suggests that previously reported associations may not, in fact, exist highlighting the need to meticulously adjust for confounding variables in novel biomarker studies. However, subgroup analysis showed that stromal SPARC expression is associated with better disease-free survival among patients who are not treated with chemotherapy.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background & objectives: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known to be the main cause of cervical cancer. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes in smear specimens taken from women who had normal or abnormal cytology using a multiplex PCR method. Method(s): The study included 270 women aged between 19 and 69 yr with or without suspicious cervical abnormalities. A Pap smear sample from each patient was cytologically examined, and HPV typing was performed using a multiplex fluorescent PCR method. Those who were high-risk HPV positive and had a normal or abnormal cytology were further evaluated by colposcopy and biopsy. Result(s): The total HPV positivity was 43 per cent (116/270). HPV positivity in the patients with an abnormal cytology was 77 per cent (33/43), whereas it was only 37 per cent (83/227) in women with normal cytology, which showed a significant difference (P<0.05). HPV positivity was also related to the age group when all the subjects were considered (P<0.05), and the highest prevalence of HPV infection was in the 30-39 yr age group. High-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 35, 51 and 56 were more common in the normal cytology patients, whereas high-risk HPV types 16, 31, 35, 45, 58 and 68 were commonly found in the abnormal cytology patients. Interpretation & conclusions: The determination of high-risk HPV genotypes in women with clinically suspicious cervical lesions should be conducted during an annual follow-up, irrespective of a normal or abnormal cytology by the age of 30 years or above.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: T cell receptor (TCR) signaling profile is a fundamental property that underpins both adaptive and innate immunity in the host. Despite its potential clinical relevance, the TCR repertoire in peripheral blood has not been thoroughly explored for its value as an immunotherapy efficacy biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The purpose of the present study is to characterize and compare the TCR repertoire in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with HNSCC treated with the combination of cetuximab and nivolumab. METHODS: We used the immunoSEQ assay to sequence the TCR beta (TCR-B) chain repertoire from serially obtained PBMC at baseline and during the treatments from a total of 41 patients who received the combination (NCT03370276). Key TCR repertoire metrics, including diversity and clonality, were calculated and compared between patients with different therapy responses and clinical characteristics (eg, human papillomavirus (HPV) status and smoking history). Patient survival outcomes were compared according to patient groups stratified by the TCR-B clonotyping. To confirm the observed patterns in TCR spectrum, samples from patients who achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were further profiled with the immunoSEQ deep resolution assay. RESULTS: Our data indicated that the patients who achieved CR and PR had an increased TCR sequence diversity in their baseline samples, this tendency being more pronounced in HPV-negative patients or those with a smoking history. Notably, the CR/PR group had the lowest proportion of patients with oligoclonal TCR clones (2 out of 8 patients), followed by the stable disease group (9 out of 20 patients) and lastly the progressive disease group (7 out of 10 patients). An overall trend toward favorable patient survival was also observed in the polyclonal group. Finally, we reported the shared TCR clones across patients within the same response group, as well as the shared clones by aligning immunoSEQ reads with TCR data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (TCGA-HNSC) cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, despite the great clinical heterogeneity of HNSCC and the limited responders in the present cohort, the peripheral TCR repertoires from pretreatment PBMC may be developed as biomarkers for the benefit of immunotherapy in HNSCC.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death for women in low-resource settings. The World Health Organization recommends that cervical cancer screening programs incorporate HPV DNA testing, but available tests are expensive, require laboratory infrastructure, and cannot be performed at the point-of-care. We developed a two-dimensional paper network (2DPN), hybrid-capture, signal amplification assay and a point-of-care sample preparation protocol to detect high-risk HPV DNA from exfoliated cervical cells within an hour. The test does not require expensive equipment and has an estimated cost of <$3 per test without the need for batching. We evaluated performance of the paper HPV DNA assay with short synthetic and genomic HPV DNA targets, HPV positive and negative cellular samples, and two sets of clinical samples. The first set of clinical samples consisted of 16 biobanked, provider-collected cervical samples from a study in El Salvador previously tested with careHPV and subsequently tested in a controlled laboratory environment. The paper HPV DNA test correctly identified eight of eight HPV-negative clinical samples and seven of eight HPV-positive clinical samples. We then performed a field evaluation of the paper HPV DNA test in a hospital laboratory in Mozambique. Cellular controls generated expected results throughout field testing with fully lyophilized sample preparation and 2DPN reagents. When evaluated with 16 residual self-collected cervicovaginal samples previously tested by the GeneXpert HPV assay ("Xpert"), the accuracy of the HPV DNA paper test in the field was reduced compared to testing in the controlled laboratory environment, with positive results obtained for all eight HPV-positive samples as well as seven of eight HPV-negative samples. Further evaluation showed reduction in performance was likely due in part to increased concentration of exfoliated cells in the self-collected clinical samples from Mozambique compared with provider-collected samples from El Salvador. Finally, a formal usability assessment was conducted with users in El Salvador and Mozambique; the assay was rated as acceptable to perform after minimal training. With additional optimization for higher cell concentrations and inclusion of an internal cellular control, the paper HPV DNA assay offers promise as a low-cost, point-of-care cervical cancer screening test in low-resource settings.Copyright © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is associated with a subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and mouth or throat warts. However, there is currently limited information about oral HPV infections in Nigeria. Objective(s): This study aimed to provide information on the occurrence and circulating genotypes of HPV among patients attending three (one government and two private) dental clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria. Method(s): An oral swab was collected from 231 dental clinic attendees in Ibadan between January 2016 and March 2017 and tested for HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction targeting the E6/7 genes of the virus. Result(s): Twenty-three of the 231 swab samples were HPV DNA positive comprising 16 monoinfections and seven co-infections in 13 males and ten females. Genotype 16 was present in ten patients, genotype 6/11 in five, Genotype 18 and genotype 33 in four each, genotype 31 in three and genotype 39 in one. Twenty-one cases were high-risk HPV genotypes, while two were low-risk. Samples had co-infection and five had low risk type 6/11 either as single or as co-infection. Persons who had engaged in oral sex as well as those aged 21-30 years has significantly higher prevalence. Conclusion(s): This study showed that although HPV genotype 16 is the most common type among dental clinic attendees in Ibadan, other genotypes are also circulating and that oral sex is a risk factor for the infection. Therefore, introducing a multivalent HPV vaccine will reduce the risk of HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma and other cancers in Nigeria. Copyright:Copyright © 2022. The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in keratoacanthoma (KA) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To identify possible differences in HPV DNA, detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS), between KAs and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs), which may suggest different pathogenesis. MATERIALS & METHODS: We extracted DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from samples of 151 patients (105 with cSCCs and 46 with KAs). HPV DNA was detected using the NGS-based Ezplex(R) kit. HPV detection rates and other clinical characteristics were compared. RESULTS: HPV was detected in 6.7% (7/105) of cSCC and 10.9% (5/46) of KA samples. Eight alpha-HPV genotypes (16, 57, 81, 31, 33, 45, 53, and 58) were detected, with HPV 16 being the most common. Only one type (57) is commonly classified as cutaneous type, and the rest are all mucosal types. HPV detection rate did not significantly differ between the KA and cSCC groups. CONCLUSION: HPV detection was relatively low in KA and cSCC samples. HPV might be related to the pathogenesis of only selected KA and cSCC cases.

AB  - Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major risk factor for oral and cervical cancers. Hence, we developed a multianalyte electrochemical DNA biosensor that could be used for both oral and cervical samples to detect the high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18. The assay involves the sandwich hybridization of the HPV target to the silica-redox dye reporter probe and capture probe, followed by electrochemical detection. The sensor was found to be highly specific and sensitive, with a detection limit of 22 fM for HPV-16 and 20 fM for HPV-18, between the range of 1 fM and 1 microM. Evaluation with oral and cervical samples showed that the biosensor result was consistent with the nested PCR/gel electrophoresis detection. The biosensor assay could be completed within 90 min. Due to its simplicity, rapidity, and high sensitivity, this biosensor could be used as an alternative method for HPV detection in clinical laboratories as well as for epidemiological studies.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) and/or high-risk (Hr-) HPV are the main causes of cervical cancer. Another element that may contribute to the development of cervical cancer is the microbiota. To date, no study has investigated the entire cervical microbiome, which consists of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In this study, cervical samples with different histopathology (CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3), with or without HPV16 and Hr-HPVs infection, were enrolled. From bacterial community analysis, 115 bacterial species were found and separated into 2 distinct categories based on Lactobacillus abundance: Lactobacilli-dominated (LD) and non-Lactobacilli-dominated (NLD) groups. The LD group had significantly less bacterial diversity than the NLD group. In addition, the variety of bacteria was contingent on the prevalence of HPV infection. Among distinct histological groups, an abundance of L. iners (>60% of total Lactobacillus spp.) was discovered in both groups. A few fungi, e.g., C. albicans, were identified in the fungal community. The viral community analysis revealed that the presence of HPV considerably reduced the diversity of human viruses. Taken together, when we analyzed all our results collectively, we discovered that HPV infection was a significant determinant in the diversity of bacteria and human viruses in the cervix.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although penile cancer (PC) is uncommon in developed countries, it is widespread in developing countries. The state of Maranhao (Northeast, Brazil) has the highest global incidence recorded for PC, and, despite its socioeconomic vulnerability, it has been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study aimed to determine the histopathological features, the prevalence of HPV infection, and the immunohistochemical profile of PC in Maranhao. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 200 PC cases were evaluated. HPV detection was performed using nested-PCR followed by direct sequencing for genotyping. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using monoclonal antibodies anti-p16(INK4a), p53, and ki-67. RESULTS: Our data revealed a delay of 17 months in diagnosis, a high rate of penile amputation (96.5%), and HPV infection (80.5%) in patients from Maranhao (Molecular detection). We demonstrated the high rate of HPV in PC also by histopathological and IHC analysis. Most patients presented koilocytosis (75.5%), which was associated with those reporting more than 10 different sexual partners during their lifetime (p = 0.001). IHC revealed frequent p16(INK4a) overexpression (26.0%) associated with basaloid (p < 0.001) and high-grade tumors (p = 0.008). Interestingly, p16 appears not to be a better prognostic factor in our disease-free survival analysis, as previously reported. We also demonstrated high ki-67 and p53 expression in a subset of cases, which was related to worse prognostic factors such as high-grade tumors, angiolymphatic and perineural invasion, and lymph node metastasis. We found a significant impact of high ki-67 (p = 0.002, log-rank) and p53 (p = 0.032, log-rank) expression on decreasing patients' survival, as well as grade, pT, stage, pattern, and depth of invasion (p < 0.05, log-rank). CONCLUSIONS: Our data reaffirmed the high incidence of HPV infection in PC cases from Maranhao and offer new insights into potential factors that may contribute to the high PC incidence in the region. We highlighted the possible association of HPV with worse clinical prognosis factors, differently from what was observed in other regions. Furthermore, our IHC analysis reinforces p16, ki-67, and p53 expression as important diagnosis and/or prognosis biomarkers, potentially used in the clinical setting in emerging countries such as Brazil.

AB  - Mucosal high-risk (HR) human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with anogenital carcinogenesis. The products of two early genes, E6 and E7, act as major viral oncoproteins. Functional studies in experimental models showed that HPV16 E6 induces degradation of the PDZ protein, the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1). Here, we determined NHERF-1 protein levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in (i) benign anogenital warts (n = 8) (ii) premalignant lesions (L-SIL and H-SIL) (n = 43) and (iii) invasive cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (n = 17). A decrease of NHERF-1 protein level was not observed in genital warts in comparison to healthy epithelium. Conversely, a clearly decrease in NHERF-1 protein levels was observed in HPV16-positive pre-malignant and malignant lesions, while the phenomenon was much attenuated in lesions induced by other HR HPV types. In conclusion, these findings show that mucosal HPV types differently impact on NHERF-1 protein level in benign and malignant anogenital lesions.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction Cervical cancer is an important public health problem in Ethiopia. However, the disease is not well characterized and studied in various parts of the country. This study was designed to describe the histopathological profile of cervical biopsies and to identify risk factors associated with high-grade cervical lesions and cancer (CIN2+C). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Compressive Specialized Hospital (FHCSH) between 1 March 2019 and 30 October 2021. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the participants' demographic, reproductive and gynecologic history. From women presented with different degrees of cervical lesions, a senior gynecologist collected cervical swabs using (Digene HC2 DNA collection device: Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for detection of high-risk Human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) and punch biopsy for histopathological examinations. HR-HPVs were detected using the Abbott Alinity m system following the manufacturer protocol at the Institute of Virology, Leipzig University Hospital, Germany. Collected data entered and analyzed using SPSS version 25. A logistic regression model was used for both bivariable & multivariable analysis in order to determine the association between independent variables and CIN2+C. Statistical significance was set at a p-value <0.05. Results In this study, 335 women were included; the mean age was at 46.5+/-11.4 years. Most were living in rural settings, 221(66%) and had no formal education, 259 (77.3%). More than half of the participants, 193(57.6%) were unaware of cervical cancer. The prevalence of HIV infection and previous history of cervical screening were 44(13.1%) and 93(27.8%), respectively. HR-HPVs were detected in 178(54.3%) of the participants. The majority of biopsies, 140(41.8%; 95%CI: 36.6-47.1%), were diagnosed as cervical carcinoma. Normal histology, cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1, CIN-2, and CIN-3 accounted for 74 (22.1%), 30(9.0%), 40(11.9%), 12(3.6%), and 12(3.6%), respectively. High-grade lesions and cancer (CIN2+C) together accounted 164(49.0%; 95%CI: 43.6-54.2). Cervical cancer increased steadily with the age of the participants (p<0.001) in which women above the age of fifty were approximately four times more likely to develop CIN2+C than the younger ones (AOR: 3.73; 95%CI: 1.80-7.82; p<0.001). Likewise, no screening history in the last five years (AOR: 2.03; 95%CI: 1.05-3.92; p = 0.035) and being infected with HR-HPVs (AOR: 14.23; 95%CI: 7.9-25.64; p<0.001) were found significantly associated with CIN2+C. Conclusions The findings of this study revealed that cervical cancer continues to be an important women's health challenge in northwest Ethiopia. Postmenopausal women, who had no screening history within a five-year period and those women who tested positive for HR-HPV need special attention. It is important to increase the awareness of women about cervical cancer and actions for early detection of precancerous lesions should be expanded.Copyright © 2022 Derbie et al.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a major cause of cervical cancer worldwide. Knowledge of the geographical distribution and epidemiology of the most common HPV genotypes is a crucial step in developing prevention strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate HPV genotype distribution among HPV-positive women and men in Tehran, Iran. Study Design: A case series study. Method(s): The study was performed on 219 HPV-positive individuals (160 females and 59 males) from Tehran, Iran. Samples were obtained from the cervix and vagina of female subjects and the genital warts of male subjects. DNA was extracted from samples, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-reverse dot blot genotyping chip was used to examine HPV genotypes. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 51 patients from the study population were also included in this study. Result(s): The proportion of high-risk (HR)-HPV was 67.12%. The most common HR-HPV types were HR-HPV16 (17.4%), HR-HPV68 (11.4%), and HR-HPV51 (7.8%). The most common low-risk (LR)-HPV types included LR-HPV6 (31.1%), LR-HPV81 (11.9%), and LR-HPV62 (11.4%). The highest prevalence of HPV was in the age group of > 30 years (42.9%). Co-infection with multiple HR-HPV types was observed in 22.4% of specimens. Moreover, HR-HPV was found in 50% of women with normal cytology, 100% with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 84.61% with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Conclusion(s): The results indicated the remarkable growth of HR-HPV68, which has rarely been reported in Iran. The findings add knowledge to HPV epidemiological investigation and emphasize the need for introducing educational programs in high schools and appropriate vaccination in Iran.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s); Published by Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: Most data on prognostic factors for penile cancer (PC) are based on small cohort sizes, and even meta-analyses are limited in patient numbers. So in many situations there is a lack of evidence for clinical decisions. About 50% of PC are HPV-associated, but there are conflicting data about the influence of HPV-status on prognosis. Method(s): Clinical data and tissue samples from 276 patients with PC from Germany, Russia and Portugal were collected. HPV-Status was determined by genotyping and p16-immunostaining. Survival data were analysed by Kaplan-Meier estimator, log rank test and uni- and multivariate analysis using Cox regression model in relation to TNM stage, HPV and histological subtype. Result(s): In multivariate analysis, pN2-3 was significantly associated with worse cancer specific (CSS), metastasis free (MFS) and overall survival (OS) (p = <0.001). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was an independent prognostic parameter for worse CSS (p = 0.005) and OS (p = 0.007), whereas MFS was significantly different between pT1b and pT1a (p = 0.017). In pN0-patients, LVI was significant for MFS (p = 0.032). Grading and perineural invasion were significant in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. HPV-status was not associated with prognosis. Histological subtypes differ in prognosis, without reaching statistical significance. Discussion(s): In accordance with literature lymphatic involvement had the most significant influence on prognosis. So the poor prognosis in the pT1b-group seems to be due to the inclusion of cases with LVI in this group. Conclusion(s): As LVI is a significant independent prognostic parameter, the inclusion of tumor-grade and LVI in a single T-category (pT1b) seems questionable. Histological subtype should always be determined, whereas HPV-status seems to be of minor clinical relevance. Nodal negative patients with LVI are on a higher risk of metastasis. Therefore, LVI should be considered as an important factor in the decision making process after treatment of the primary tumor.

AB  - Background: Cervical dysplasia are caused by HPV and accompanied by cellular biomarker upregulation. Screening programs switch from cytology to HPV testing. While HPV tests have a higher sensitivity (95% vs. 50%), the specificity is low (<40%). Expression quantitation of cellular progression-associated biomarkers may enhance specificity and diagnosis of dysplastic stages. QuantiGene-Molecular Profiling Histology (QG-MPH) assay enables efficient multiplexed HPV oncogene and biomarker mRNA detection and quantitation. Method(s): The QG-MPH assay was designed, individually quantifying E7 oncogene mRNA of 18 high-risk HPVs, cellular housekeeping genes, and 10 established biomarkers in a multiplexed format. On a referral population logistic regression and ROC-analyses were performed and risk scores with related cut-off values were calculated for disease stages CIN2+, CIN3+, and CxCa. A nested sample set (550 patients) of a population-based cohort (MARZY study, Mainz, Germany) was reanalysed. The risk score results were compared to standard of care screening methods (PAP, LBC, HC2, GP5+/6+-PCR) and four different co-testing variants (PAP+HC2, PAP+PCR, LBC+HC2, LBC+PCR). Histological endpoints CIN2+ and CIN3+ were evaluated. Result(s): 61 women (all peculiar plus 5% randomly selected healthy controls) had a histology endpoint. Nine CIN2+ and six CIN3+ were histologically confirmed. Sensitivity and specificity for detection by QG-MPH risk scores was 67% and 83% for CIN2+, and 83% and 82% for CIN3+, respectively. Cytology was less sensitive (PAP: 33%; LBC: 33%) and similarly specific (PAP: 79%; LBC: 89%) for the detection of CIN3+. The HPV tests and the four co-testing strategies had similar sensitivities (83%) but lower specificities (range 26-67%). Discussion/Conclusion: Due to equal sensitivity but significantly higher specificity compared to all HPV-and co-testing approaches to detect CIN3+, the QG-MPH assay presents a potentially superior method for cervical cancer screening. These data warrant further assay evaluation in larger prospective screening cohorts.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (HPV-) differ prognostically and on a molecular level. Traditionally, surgical margins are assessed patho-histologically, primarily utilizing light-microscopy. Molecular changes in the tumor bed may predate microscopically detectable changes and could result in locoregional recurrence. We aimed to compare DNA methylation and RNA expression in the primary tumor, the tumor-free resection margin, and healthy mucosa obtained from OPSCC patients. Method(s): After informed consent, snap-frozen tissue samples of the tumor, resection margin, and healthy mucosa from 29 OPSCC patients were obtained intraoperatively. Total RNA and DNA were extracted using AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). DNA methylation profiling was performed using Infinium Methylation EPIC 850K, and RNA sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2500 (16 tumors) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (rest). Data analysis was performed in R (4.0.2). Result(s): All margin samples were taken from clear resection margin tissue (R0) with a mean distance of 9mm to the tumor. Exploratory and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed an aggregation based on tissue type irrespective of HPV status. Significant differences in DNA methylation and gene expression between OPSCC tumor, resection margin, and healthy mucosa samples were detected. Discussion(s): Resection margin data displayed distinct signatures converging minimally with tumor while intersecting heavily with healthy tissue signatures. Conclusion(s): This project continues establishing methylation and expression signatures for OPSCC tumor, margin, and healthy mucosa using Nanopore sequencing.

AB  - Background: In this pilot study we evaluate a systematic approach towards human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling for non-responders to the German cervical cancer screening program. In 2020, the renewed organized screening program with co-testing (HPV test + cytology) in 3-yearly intervals was started for all women 35 years and older. In the past, the participation rate was around 70% in a time frame of three years. The non-participators are at higher risk to develop invasive cervical cancer. The willingness to participate can be improved by offering self-sampling devices for home-based use. Based on this information, the Hannover Self-Collection study was started to examine the response rate and practicability of a systematic self-sampling approach. Method(s): 20.000 women aged 30 to 65 years living in the city and region of Hannover, Lower Saxony were randomly included. 10.000 women directly received a self-sampling kit, the other 10.000 a letter of information and option to participate in the study (opt-out vs. opt-in strategy). Stratifications were be made by age (7 cohorts) and area of living (city vs rural). Women tested positive for high-risk HPV (PCR-based HPV assay) were prompted to get a cytological smear by their gynecologist. Women with normal cytology will be re-checked after 6 months. Suspicious cytology results lead to an immediate colposcopy. Result(s): The study is executed between December 2021 and May 2022. First results will be presented at the congress. Discussion and Conclusion(s): To get hold of non-responders to cervical cancer screening programs, self-sampling for HPV is a promising option. Aim of this study is to generate an overall recommendation to improve cervical cancer screening in Germany, especially for non-responders.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major pathogen for cervical lesions. The evasion mechanism of the immune response and persistence of HPV infection can be influenced by polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which may change the peptide binding affinity or the TAP expression impacting the efficiency of peptide transport in the secretory pathway, and the presentation of peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This study aimed to evaluate the role of the TAP1 and TAP2 polymorphisms, TAP1, and TAP2 genes expressions, and protein levels in cervical cells presenting different degrees of pre-cancerous lesions in 296 immunocompetent women infected or not by HPV. TAP SNPs were genotyped by Sanger sequencing, and gene expression by real-time PCR. Aneuploidy was determined by DNA index using flow cytometry. TAP-1 and TAP-2 tissue expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The Asp697Gly SNP of TAP1 presented a risk for cellular aneuploidy (P=0.0244). HPV+ women had higher TAP-2 mRNA (P=0.0212) and protein (P<0.0001) levels. The TAP2D and TAP2E haplotypes were associated with the risk for aneuploidy and pre-cancerous lesions. In conclusion, nucleotide variability at the peptide binding region of peptide transporter genes, particularly of the TAP2 gene, may influence the HPV-peptide transportation from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing the susceptibility to the development of high-grade cervical lesions.Copyright © 2022 Medeiros, Silva, Silva, Gomes, Gomes, Paiva, dos Santos Gomes, Peixoto, Rygaard, Welkovic, Menezes, Donadi and Lucena-Silva.

AB  - Viral metagenomics is widely employed to identify novel viruses in biological samples. Recently, although numerous novel human papillomavirus (HPV) types have been identified in clinical samples including anogenital warts (AGWs), many novel HPV sequences remain to be discovered. In this study, a putative novel HPV type designated as HPV-JDFY01 was discovered from library GW05 with 63 sequence reads by the viral metagenomic technique. Its complete genomic sequence was determined by PCR to bridge the gaps between contigs combining Sanger sequencing. The complete genome of HPV-JDFY01 is a 7186 bp encoding 7 open reading frames (ORFs) (E6, E7, E1, E2, E4, L2 and L1) and contains a 487 bp long control region (LCR) between L1 and E6. Sequence and phylogeny analysis indicated that HPV-JDFY01 shared the highest sequence identity of 74.2% with HPV-mSK_244 (MH777383) and well clustered into the genus Gammapapillomavirus. It has the classical genomic organization of Gammapapillomaviruses. Epidemiological investigation showed that one out of the 413 AGW tissue samples was positive for HPV-JDFY01. Further research with large size and different type of samples should be performed to elucidate the epidemiologic status of HPV-JDFY01.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are characterized by strong cellular and molecular heterogeneity and treatment resistance entailing poor survival. Besides cell-intrinsic properties, carcinoma cells receive important cues from non-malignant cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the TME that impact on the molecular make-up of malignant cells and have a decisive function in tumor progression. However, the potential functionality of fibroblasts within tumor-adjacent, macroscopically normal tissue remains poorly explored. Method(s): Here, we isolated primary peritumoral fibroblasts (PtFs) from macroscopically normal tissue in vicinity of primary human papillomavirus-negative and -positive oropharyngeal HNSCC and compared their phenotype and functionality with matched CAFs (n = 5 pairs) and with human oral fibroblasts (hOFs). Result(s): Expression patterns of CD90, CD73, CD105, smooth muscle actin, Vimentin, and S100A4 were comparable in PtFs, CAFs, and hOFs. Cell proliferation and doubling times of CAFs and PtFs were heterogeneous across patients (n =2 PtF>CAF; n = 1 CAF>PtF; n = 2 CAF=PtF) and reflected inferior growth than hOFs. Furthermore, PtFs displayed an reduced heterogeneity in cell size compared to matched CAFs, which were characterized by the presence of single large cells. Overall, conditioned supernatants from CAFs had more frequently growth-promoting effects on a panel of carcinoma cell lines of the upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma cell lines (Cal27, Cal33, FaDu, and Kyse30), whereas significant differences in migration-inducing effects demonstrated a higher potential of PtFs. Except for Kyse30, CAFs were significantly superior to hOFs in promoting proliferation, while PtFs induced stronger migration than hOFs in all carcinoma lines tested. Analysis of soluble factors demonstrated significantly increased VEGF-A production in CAFs (except in pat.8), and significantly increased PDGF-BB production in PtFs of two patients. Tube formation assays confirmed a significantly enhanced angiogenic potential of conditioned supernatants from CAFs compared to hOFs on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Discussion(s): Hence, matched CAFs and PtFs present in HNSCC patients are heterogeneous in their proliferation-, migration-, and angiogenesis-promoting capacity. Despite this heterogeneity, CAFs induced stronger carcinoma cell proliferation and HUVEC tube formation overall, whereas PtFs promoted migration of tumor cells more strongly.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Schwenk-Zieger, Kranz, Walz, Klauschen, Dhawan, Canis, Gires, Haubner, Baumeister and Kohlbauer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although a considerable body of knowledge has been accumulated regarding the early diagnosis and treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), its survival rates have not improved over the last decades. Thus, deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing oral cancer will support the development of even better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Previous studies have linked aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) with the development of OSCC. METHODS: We combined bioinformatical and molecular methods to identify miRNAs with possible clinical significance as biomarkers in OSCC. A set of 10 miRNAs were selected via an in silico approach by analysing the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of cancer-related mRNAs such as FLRT2, NTRK3, and SLC8A1, TFCP2L1 and etc. RT-qPCR was used to compare the expression of in silico identified miRNAs in OSCC and normal tissues (n=32). RESULTS: Among the screened miRNAs, miR-21-5p (p < 0.0001), miR-93-5p (p < 0.0197), miR-146b-5p (p <0.0012), miR-155-5p (p < 0.0001), miR-182-5p (p < 0.0001) were significantly overexpressed, whereas miR-133b (p < 0.05) was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissues, a scenario confirmed in two additional OSCC validation cohorts: Regina Elena National Cancer Institute (IRE cohort, N=74) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal (TCGA cohort, N=354). Initial stage tumors (T1, T2) expressed significantly higher levels of miR-133b (p < 0.0004) compared to more advanced ones (T3, T4). Also, we identified miR-93-5p (p < 0.0003), miR-133b (p < 0.0017) and miR-155-5p (p < 0.0004) as correlated with HPV-induced OSCC. The high expression of these 6 miRNAs as a signature predicted shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and could efficiently distinguish OSCC cases from healthy controls with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 with sensitivity and specificity of 0.98 and 0.6, respectively. Further target identification analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in FOXO, longevity, glycan biosynthesis and p53 cancer-related signaling pathways. Also, the selected targets were underexpressed in OSCC tissues and showed clinical significance related to overall survival (OS) and DFS. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that a novel panel consisting of miR-21-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-133b, miR-146b-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-182-5p could be used as OSCC-specific molecular signature with diagnostic and prognostic significance related to OS and DFS.

AB  - The authors compared the clinical performance of DH3 human papillomavirus (HPV) assay, which detects 14 high-risk HPVs with 16/18 genotyping based on hybrid capture technique, and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test for women undergoing cervical cancer screening. A total of 7, 263 residual cytology specimens from an adjudicated cohort with 3-year follow-up were tested by the DH3 assay and the HC2 test. Assay results were compared with each other and to histology review. The overall agreement between the DH3 assay and the HC2 test was 99.2% (kappa = 0.938). At baseline, DH3 had the equal sensitivity to that of HC2 for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or higher (CIN2+, n = 75) and CIN grade 3 or higher (CIN3+, n = 45), 98.67% and 97.78%, respectively. After 3 years of follow-up, the sensitivity for CIN2+ (n = 133) and CIN3+ (n = 74) were both similar between DH3 and HC2 (95.49% vs 94.74%, 95.95% vs 95.95%, respectively, all P > 0.05). The respective specificity for CIN2+ or CIN3+ did not differ between the two tests. A noninferiority test showed that both sensitivity and specificity of DH3 for CIN2+ and CIN3+ were noninferior to those of HC2 at baseline and after 3-year follow-up, respectively (all P < 0.001). When used in primary screening strategy, the DH3 assay would yield an immediate sensitivity of 92% for CIN2+. DH3 HPV performs equally to HC2 for the detection of high-grade lesions in cervical cancer screening and has a potential advantage in primary screening strategy due to HPV16/18 genotyping. IMPORTANCE The benefits of testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) in cervical cancer screening have already been demonstrated. Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) is the best validated HPV assay and has been considered the gold standard for hrHPV testing. However, HC2 cannot discriminate HPV16 and 18 from the other hrHPV types, which greatly limited the application of HC2 in cervical cancer screening. The DH3 human papillomavirus (HPV) is a recently developed assay based on hybrid capture technique like to HC2, which can specifically identify HPV 16/18 on the basis of detecting the 13 hrHPV types targeted by HC2 as well as HPV66. This comparative study of the two assays for detection of hrHPV infection in residual cytology samples from cervical cancer screening setting reveals that DH3 HPV provides a perfect alternative to HC2 in detecting hrHPV infection and identifying cervical precancer, while allowing concurrent HPV 16/18 genotyping.

AB  - Objectives: This retrospective chart review study was conducted in France (FR), Germany (DE), and the United Kingdom (UK) to describe demographics, clinical characteristics, first (1L) and second line (2L) treatment patterns for patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in the real-world setting. Method(s): This chart review study examined patients newly diagnosed with R/M SCCHN between 01-June-2017 and 01-June-2018. Twenty-four oncologists contributed data on 101 patients (FR: N = 35, DE: N = 31, and UK: N = 35) age >=18 years with histologically confirmed R/M SCCHN of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients enrolled in cancer treatment-related clinical trials since their R/M SCCHN diagnosis were excluded. Demographics and treatment data were analyzed descriptively. Result(s): Patients were a mean (SD) age of 63 (9) years, and 83% were current or former tobacco users. 72% had documented HPV testing, of which 49% were positive. Only 25% were tested for PD-L1 expression prior to 1L, with 77% of those being >= 1. At 1L treatment initiation, 66% were platinum naive/de novo, 18% were platinum sensitive, with the remainder platinum ineligible/refractory. Most (75%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. In the 1L, EXTREME regimen (Cetuximab + Cisplatin or Carboplatin + 5-Fluorouracil) was administered to 38%, 41% received other platinum-based therapy with/without a taxane, 11% received nivolumab as a single agent, 9% received other cetuximab-based therapy, and 1% received pembrolizumab. 15% received radiotherapy in the 1L of treatment. Of the total, 64 patients (63%) received a 2L therapy. Of these, 78% received nivolumab and 3%, pembrolizumab. Conclusion(s): Between 2017 and 2018, platinum-based regimens including EXTREME continued to be the mainstay of 1L R/M SCCHN in these countries, with immunotherapy having high uptake in 2L.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Purpose: Although sinonasal inverted papilloma malignant transformation has not been entirely understood, some studies have suggested that human papillomavirus acts as a potential oncogenic agent in the progression of sinonasal inverted papilloma to squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between human papillomavirus infection and sinonasal inverted papilloma transformation, taking also into account human papillomavirus types and their distribution in different geographic areas. Material(s) and Method(s): The literature from the last 25 years was examined. The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Result(s): A total of 163 malignant sinonasal inverted papilloma and 961 non-malignant sinonasal inverted papilloma were included in the overall analysis. From this sample it was possible to recognize a statistically significant increase in risk of malignancy of sinonasal inverted papilloma for human papillomavirus infection (OR = 2.43, 95 % CI: 1.45-4.08, I2 = 14.0 %). A positive association for patients with high-risk human papillomavirus types was noted (OR = 10.20, 95 % CI: 3.66-28.42, I2 = 15.9 %). In all the 3 geographical areas analyzed the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus significantly increased the probability of malignant transformation. Conclusion(s): High-risk human papillomavirus infection plays a key role in the malignant transformation of sinonasal inverted papilloma and its research during histological examination can be of paramount importance. More prospective studies are needed to help further tease out this association.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Objective: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical adenocarcinoma are the most common human papillomavirus (HPV)-related diseases. The present study is aimed at examining the association between diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota in HPV-positive and HPV-negative Iranian women by quantitative PCR. Method(s): In this study, 69 vaginal samples with and without manifestation of HPV were obtained from women referring to a gynecology clinic and extracted DNA was introduced to real-time PCR looking for the HPV serotypes and bacterial load by using bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Result(s): Out of 64 samples, 16 isolates were normal, 13 isolates were clearance or HPV-negative, and 16 isolates were persistence or HPV-positive. Lactobacillus spp. is the predominant vaginal microbiota in normal women and its count became lower at HPV-negative and finally became zero at HPV-positive group. We could approve a significant increase in the colony count of Bacteroides, and Bifidobacteria in HPV 16 group. The statistical analysis did not show any significant association between the frequency or presence of each bacterium and the types of cervical cell abnormalities (P value <0.05). Conclusion(s): Despite the vaginal bacteria were more frequent among patients with HPV and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), it was not statistically significant.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current smoking is a risk factor for anal cancer. Yet, its association with anal human papillomavirus infection (HPV) and anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) remains unclear. We assessed the association of smoking with 1) anal high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection and 2) anal HSIL. METHODS: Data from the baseline visit of patients from the Anal Neoplasia Clinic of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (May 2015- June 2021) was analyzed. Patients were eligible if they had information on smoking status, complete high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with biopsy, and HR-HPV testing (n = 427). Logistic regression models estimated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Mean age was 44 +/- 13 years, 69% were men, 74% were HIV-infected, and 25% reported being current smokers. 74% had anal HR-HPV infection. HSIL was diagnosed in 40% of patients. Current smokers had significantly higher odds (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.04-2.82) of having HSIL compared to non-smokers after adjusting for age, sexual risk group, lifetime number of sexual partners, HIV status, and HR-HPV infection. Smoking was not associated with HR-HPV infection (OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 0.83-2.95) after adjusting for age, sexual risk group, lifetime number of sexual partners, and HIV status. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking was associated with histologically confirmed HSIL but not with HR-HPV infection among this high-risk Hispanic population. Results highlight the need to explore targeted smoking cessation campaigns among populations at higher risk of developing HSIL, as an anal cancer prevention strategy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Due to a wide range of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types associated with genital cancers; HPV genotyping remains important for the introduction of an appropriate vaccine, disease diagnosis, follow-up and epidemiological surveys. Currently, available molecular genotyping assays are not only expensive but also requires dedicated and expensive equipment which is not feasible in the majority of low-and-middle-socioeconomic countries. The purpose of the study was to develop and evaluated a cost-effective nested-multiplex polymerase chain reaction (NM-PCR) assay for HPV genotyping. METHODS: HPV-DNA containing plasmids and cervical scrapings from histologically confirmed cervical cancer cases were used to evaluate the NM-PCR. In the first round PCR, a set of consensus primers were used to amplify 38 mucosal HPV types. HPV Type-specific primers were used in the second-round polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify 15 HPV types in three multiplex cocktails. The assay sensitivity was determined with the control panel containing one to 10(10)genome equivalents (GE). DNA sequencing was done to confirm the PCR results. RESULTS: The assay was able to amplify all HPV types and detected as few as 50GE per reaction. A total of 23 endo-cervical samples obtained from healthy, HPV negative subjects and 52 histologically confirmed cervical scrapings were processed for HPV genotyping by NM-PCR. HPV DNA was detected in all histologically confirmed samples. DNA sequencing results showed complete concordance with PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: The designed nested PCR based assay had good concordance with clinical histology and sequencing results and appears to be a promising tool for HPV genotyping especially in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND As shown in the statistics from the World Health Organization, it is estimated that approximately 75000 new cases of cervical cancer occur every year in China. In 2008, 33000 people died of cervical cancer in China. It is proven that most women are at risk of cervical cancer. The progression from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to cervical cancer can be several years or decades, which offers a unique opportunity to prevent cancer. AIM To observe the changes in ThinPrep cytology tests (TCT) and HPV infection in patients who were detected to be positive via TCT screening of cervical cancer and further explore the biopsy results. METHODS This paper performed a follow-up study on 206 cervical cancer screening-positive patients of 12231 total cases from our previous research. We conducted an observational study on the TCT results based on the interpretation of The Bethesda System. RESULTS Over a 5-year period, 10 cases received consistent follow-up. The proportions of cases in which glandular epithelial lesions were detected increased over the follow-up period. The differences between the years were statistically significant (P < 0.01). Over the 5 years, the proportion of patients whose squamous epithelial lesions transformed into glandular epithelial lesions increased yearly. Annual positive rates of HPV infection were: year 1, 73% (24/33); year 2, 43% (6/14); year 3, 36% (9/25); year 4, 50% (9/18); and year 5, 25% (6/24). The positive detection rate after biopsy over a 9-year period was 29%. CONCLUSION The follow-up study for 5 years to 9 years revealed a tendency to change from squamous epithelial lesions to glandular epithelial lesions and an improvement of the disease (which had not been reported previously). The HPV test indicated a high negative conversion ratio of the viral infection. However, the follow-up cases were not found to have persistent infection of high-risk HPV. Therefore, early intervention of cervical cancer screening is necessary. Low re-examination compliance, patient education, and preventive measures should be enhanced.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPC) accounts for 3% of all cancers and greater than 1.5% of all cancer deaths in the United States, with marked treatment-associated morbidity in survivors. More than 80% of OPC is caused by HPV16. Tumors induced by HPV have been linked to impaired immune functions, with most studies focused on the local tumor microenvironment. Fewer studies have characterized the effects of these tumors on systemic responses in OPC, especially innate responses that drive subsequent adaptive responses, potentially creating feed-back loops favorable to the tumor. Here we report that elevated plasma levels of PGE2 are expressed in half of patients with OPC secondary to overexpression of COX-2 by peripheral blood monocytes, and this expression is driven by IL-1alpha secreted by the tumors. Monocytes from patients are much more sensitive to the stimulation than monocytes from controls, suggesting the possibility of enhanced immune-modulating feed-back loops. Furthermore, control monocytes pre-exposed to PGE2 overexpress COX-2 in response to IL-1alpha, simulating responses made by monocytes from some OPC patients. Disrupting the PGE2/IL-1alpha feed-back loop can have potential impact on targeted medical therapies.Copyright © 2022 DeVoti, Israr, Lam, Papayannakos, Frank, Kamdar, Pereira, Abramson, Steinberg and Bonagura.

AB  - Helminth infection-driven changes to immunity in the female reproductive tract (FRT) is an immune axis that is currently understudied but can have major implications for the control of FRT infections. Here we address how human hookworm infection associates with vaginal immune profile and risk of Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Stool, blood, cervical swabs and vaginal flushes were collected from women from the Central region of Togo to screen for hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale) and high carcinogenic risk HPV types, via Kato Katz and PCR, respectively. Cytokine, chemokine and immunoglobulin levels were analysed in cervicovaginal lavages and plasma samples. A pronounced mixed Type 1/Type 2 immune response was detected in the vaginal fluids of women with hookworm infection and this immune signature was a notable feature in hookworm-HPV co-infected women. Moreover, hookworm infection is positively associated with increased risk and load of HPV infection. These findings highlight helminth infection as a significant risk factor for acquiring a sexually transmitted viral infection and potentially raising the risk of subsequent pathology.Copyright © 2022 Omondi, Kamassa, Katawa, Tchopba, Vogelbusch, Parcina, Tchadie, Amessoudji, Arndts, Karou, Ameyapoh, Kolou, Hoerauf, Layland, Horsnell and Ritter.

AB  - Background: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (NECC) is an aggressive and rare type of cervical cancer. The five-year overall survival is low at 30% and there is no standardized therapy based on controlled trials for this type of tumour. Most are locally advanced or metastasized at the time of the diagnosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) could be a carrier of viral DNA/RNA, given their vital role in cellular communication. The content of EV derived from NECC cells has not been investigated due to the lack of cell line, and it is not known whether they contain human papillomaviruses (HPV) DNA/RNA or not. Methods: The presence of viral E7 DNA/RNA in EVs purified from a culture of a recently established NECC cell line, GUMC-395, was evaluated by using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). These EVs were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for size distribution, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for morphology, Western blot for CD63, and bioanalyser for RNA quantity and quality. Results: HPV16 viral-RNA, but not DNA, was detected in EVs from GUMC-395 using ddPCR. NTA identified EVs with a mean diameter of 105.0 nm, TEM confirmed normal morphological shape and size, and Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of EV-associated proteins CD63. The EVs were found to be enriched with small RNAs using a bioanalyser. Conclusions: HPV16 RNA is found in EVs from a neuroendocrine cervical cancer and could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and used as a diagnostic biomarker.

AB  - The FAM57A (family with sequence similarity 57 member A) gene is controversially discussed to possess pro- or anti-tumorigenic potential. Here, we analyze the regulation of cellular FAM57A protein levels and study the functional role of FAM57A in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. We find that FAM57A protein expression strongly depends on cell density, with FAM57A being readily detectable at low cell density, but undetectable at high cell density. This regulation occurs post-transcriptionally and is not mirrored by corresponding changes at the RNA level. We further show that FAM57A protein levels are highly increased in cervical cancer cells cultivated at hypoxia compared to normoxia and provide evidence that FAM57A is a hypoxia-responsive gene under control of the alpha-subunit of the HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) transcription factor. Yet, the strong relative increase of FAM57A protein levels in hypoxic cells is predominantly cell-density-dependent and occurs post-transcriptionally. Other anti-proliferative effectors besides hypoxia, such as silencing of HPV E6/E7 oncogene expression in cervical cancer cells, also result in an increase of FAM57A levels compared to untreated cells. Functional analyses reveal that FAM57A repression leads to pronounced anti-proliferative as well as anti-migratory effects in cervical cancer cells. Taken together, these results provide insights into the regulation of FAM57A protein levels and reveal that they underlie a tight cell-density-dependent control. Moreover, they identify FAM57A as a critical determinant for the phenotype of cervical cancer cells, which promotes their proliferation and migration capacities.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Treatment success of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is often hindered by cisplatin resistance. As inherent and acquired therapy resistance counteracts improvement in long-term survival, novel multi-targeting strategies triggering cancer cell apoptosis are urgently required. Here, we identify the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as being significantly overexpressed in tumors of HNSCC patients (n = 604; p = 0.0059), correlating with tumor differentiation (p = 0.0002), HPV status (p = 0.00026), and perineural invasion (p = 0.0087). The VDR, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is activated by its ligand vitamin D (VitD) and analogs, triggering multiple cellular responses. As we found that the VDR was also upregulated in our cisplatin-resistant HNSCC models, we investigated its effect on overcoming cisplatin resistance. We discovered that VitD/cisplatin combinations synergistically killed even cisplatin-resistant cells at clinically achievable levels. Similar results were obtained for the clinically used VitD analog Maxacalcitol. Moreover, VitD/cisplatin combinations inhibited tumor cell migration by E-cadherin upregulation. Signaling pathway analyses revealed that VitD co-treatments triggered cancer cell death by increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein BIM. BIM's pro-apoptotic activity in HNSCC cells was confirmed by ectopic overexpression studies. Importantly, BIM expression is positively associated with HNSCC patients' (n = 539) prognosis, as high expression correlated with improved survival (p = 0.0111), improved therapy response (p = 0.0026), and remission (p = 0.004). Collectively, by identifying, for the first time, the VDR/BIM axis, we here provide a molecular rationale for the reported anti-cancer activity of VitD/analogs in combination therapies. Our data also suggest its exploitation as a potential strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance in HNSCC and other malignancies by inducing additional pro-apoptotic pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is broad consensus that only a subset of CIN3 will progress to cancer, there is currently no surefire way to predict which CIN3 will regress. Understanding the natural history of CIN3 is important, and finding markers for progression or regression could improve treatment strategies. According to the guidelines of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology of 2006, positive CIN3 p16 in women should be managed with excisional treatment (LEEP). For ethical reasons we cannot fail to treat women with CIN3 in order to study their regression capacity so we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the regression rate of CIN3 diagnosed with a biopsy by studying the histological result of the cone removed by LEEP. We also investigated age, HPV genotypes and biopsy-cone interval distance as possible regression factors. METHODS: We selected 171 women with a histological diagnosis of positive CIN3 p16 as an entry criterion. All patients underwent LEEP / biopsy. A histological diagnosis of the cone of CIN3 or higher was considered as persistence or progression, the diagnosis of CIN1 or lower was considered as regression of the lesion. We used out a logistic model to study the probability of spontaneous regression of CIN3 as a function of the patient's age, the time elapsed between the biopsy and the cone (in weeks) and the HPV genotype. RESULTS: We found that the spontaneous regression rate of CIN3 was 15,8%, which was strongly associated with the biopsy-cone interval > 11 weeks. Genotype 16, the most represented, was present both in cases of regression (77.8%) and in persistence (83.3%). Regarding age, the estimated odds ratio of the probability of observing a regression in women over 25 years of age was 0.0045 times that of women under 25 years of age (CI: 0.00020, 0.036). Neither age nor viral genotype are significant as predictors of regression. CONCLUSION: To wait at least 11 weeks from the biopsy before subjecting the woman to LEEP could prevent unnecessary LEEP procedures, considering also that from CIN3 to carcinoma it takes years before the neoplastic transformation takes place.

AB  - Objective: APOBEC3B (A3B), a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, has been gradually regarded as a key cancerous regulator. However, its expression and mechanism in cervical cancer (CC) have not been fully elucidated. This study was to investigate its expression pattern and potential mechanism on the cell cycle, as well as HPV oncogenes in CC. Method(s): Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression (GEO) were used to indicate the mRNA expression pattern of A3B in cervical cancer. Western blot assay was used to detect A3B levels in SiHa and Hela cell lines. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to explore A3B protein abundance and sublocation in cervical cancer as well as normal cervical tissues. Based on the Protein atlas (www.proteinatlas.org), A3B expression in the SiHa cell line is lower than in the HeLa cell line. Therefore, the SiHa cell line was used for A3B gene overexpression experiments while the HeLa cell line was used for knockdown experiments. Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect cell apoptosis. Biological function and cancer-related pathways of A3B were conducted using bioinformatics analysis. Result(s): A3B mRNA was significantly overexpressed in cervical cancer in TCGA-cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), GSE67522, and GSE7803. A3B was more highly expressed in cervical cancers than in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and normal controls. A3B expression was found to be progressively activated during cervical cancer development. IHC results showed that A3B was significantly higher in cervical cancer tissues than in normal cervical tissues. A3B plasmid-mediated overexpression experiments and A3B siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments showed that A3B significantly promotes cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and chemoresistance in cervical cancer cells by the p53 pathway. GO and KEGG analyses showed that A3B expression was strikingly associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune-associated pathways. Conclusion(s): Taken together, our study implies that A3B promotes cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycle and inhibits cancer cell apoptosis through the p53-mediated signaling pathway. Moreover, A3B could also contribute to chemoresistance in cervical cancer cells. It may be a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for chemoresistant cervical cancers.Copyright © 2022 Wei, Gan, Feng, Zhang, Chen, Zhao and Du.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is the main histological tumor type in the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT), including the esophagus (ESCC) and the head and neck sites, as well as the oral cavity (OCSCC), larynx (LSCC) and oropharynx (OPSCC). These tumors are induced by alcohol and tobacco exposure, with the exception of a subgroup of OPSCC linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Few genes are frequently mutated in UADT tumors, pointing to other molecular mechanisms being involved during carcinogenesis. The F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 7 (FBXL7) is a potential tumor-suppressing gene, one that is frequently hypermethylated in pancreatic cancer and where the encoded protein promotes the degradation of AURKA, BIRC5 and c-SRC. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the methylation and expression profile of FBXL7 in the UADT and the gene's association with the clinical, etiological and pathological characteristics of patients, as well as the expression of its degradation targets. Here we show that the FBXL7 gene's body is hypomethylated in the UADT, independently of histology, but not in virus-associated tumors. FBXL7 body methylation and gene expression levels were correlated in the ESCC, LSCC, OCSCC and OPSCC. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that FBXL7 protein levels are not correlated with the levels of its degradation targets, AURKA and BIRC5, in the UADT. The high discriminatory potential of FBXL7 body hypomethylation between non-tumor and tumor tissues makes it a promising biomarker.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with stable structures with high expression and tissue-specific expression. Studies have shown that circRNA dysregulation is closely related to the progression of tumours. However, the function and regulatory mechanism of most circRNAs in cervical cancer are still unclear. Method(s): CircRNAs related to cervical cancer were screened through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression of circ_0087429 in cervical cancer tissues and cells. Then, in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the role of circ_0087429 in the progression of cervical cancer. The role of the circ_0087429/miR-5003-3p/osteoglycin (OGN) axis in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was confirmed by rescue experiments, fluorescence in situ hybridization, luciferase reporter assays, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. The inhibitory effect of Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (EIF4A3) on the biogenesis of circ_0087429 was verified by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays and qRT-PCR. Result(s): circ_0087429 is significantly downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cells and negatively correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging and lymphatic metastasis in cervical cancer patients. circ_0087429 can significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cervical cancer in vitro and tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. OGN is significantly downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cells. circ_0087429 can upregulate the expression of OGN by competitively binding with miR-5003-3p, thereby reversing EMT and inhibiting the progression of cervical cancer. EIF4A3 can inhibit circ_0087429 expression by binding to its flanking regions. Conclusion(s): As a tumour suppressor, circ_0087429 regulated by EIF4A3 can reverse EMT and inhibit the progression of cervical cancer through the miR-5003-3p/OGN axis. It is expected to become a potential target for the treatment of cervical cancer.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common virus worldwide that is an etiologic agent in the development of many diseases, including cancer. Recent reports have shown the association of EBV with tumorigenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moreover, EBV has been reported to be present in tonsillar tissues, which suggests a close relationship between viral infections and tonsillar diseases, including chronic tonsillitis. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of EBV DNA in 86 patients with HNSCC, in 70 patients with chronic tonsillitis, and in 144 healthy individuals (control group) and the associations between EBV infection and clinicopathological and demographic characteristics and the use of stimulants in all study groups. The objective of this study was also to analyze the prevalence of coinfection with human papillomavirus (HPV). After prior DNA isolation, EBV detection was performed using an EBV kit by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of EBV infection in patients with HNSCC, patients with chronic tonsillitis, and the control group was 47.7%, 60%, and 24.3%, respectively. Compared to controls, a significantly higher prevalence of EBV in patients with chronic tonsillitis and HNSCC may suggest that EBV is a potential risk factor. No association was found between EBV infection and demographic or clinical data. Further studies are warranted due to inconclusive reports that were mainly related to geographic distribution, sample type, and detection technique. Considering the prevalence of the virus and the risk of serious diseases, attention should be paid to screening diagnosis and prevention of the infection.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus type 45 is a potential risk of 3-9% of cervical cancers in a geographic-dependent pattern but it is uncommon in women with normal cytology. Method(s): In this study, we aimed to investigate the HPV-45 L1 gene to find the predominant variants in women with normal cytology, as a general population. We analyzed the nucleotide and amino acid changes along the L1 gene for embedding in N-glycosylated sites, external surface loops, and for positive/negative selection. Result(s): The B1 sub-lineage was the most frequent variants (40%), followed by each of B2, A1, and A2, accounting for 20%. None of missense variations affected the HPV-45 L1 function or located in the N-glycosylated sites. Three amino acid deletions occurred in the C-terminus and seven codons were under negative selection. Also, four mutations were embedded in the surface loops; N81S in BC loop, I166V in DE loop, and S383G/N and Q392H both in HI loop. Conclusion(s): Given the importance of HPV-45 and its sub-lineages in developing cervical cancer, a phylogenetic classification of HPV-45 circulating in general population may assist in setting the screening programs, diagnosis methods, and future epidemiological studies.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Although other co-viral infections could also be considered influencing factors, cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of cervical cancer. Metagenomics have been employed in the NGS era to study the microbial community in each habitat. Thus, in this investigation, virome capture sequencing was used to examine the virome composition in the HPV-infected cervix. Based on the amount of HPV present in each sample, the results revealed that the cervical virome of HPV-infected individuals could be split into two categories: HPV-dominated (HD; >/=60%) and non-HPV-dominated (NHD; <60%). Cervical samples contained traces of several human viral species, including the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), human herpesvirus 4 (HHV4), torque teno virus (TTV), and influenza A virus. When compared to the HD group, the NHD group had a higher abundance of several viruses. Human viral diversity appears to be influenced by HPV dominance. This is the first proof that the diversity of human viruses in the cervix is impacted by HPV abundance. However, more research is required to determine whether human viral variety and the emergence of cancer are related.

AB  - Recent trends have shown a dramatic rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma strongly associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) of type 16. The genetic variability of HPV16 has been extensively studied in cervical cancer but there are very limited published data concerning the genetic variations of this HPV type in oropharyngeal cancer. In the present study, the genetic variations of HPV16 E6 gene sequences originated from a small cohort of Greek patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer were assessed. The vast majority of the sequences clustered within the European variant branch. The T350G variation was found to be the predominant one. This finding may indicate the need for further studies that could explain the possible impact of this variant in the pathomechanisms of oropharyngeal cancer.

AB  - Background: In order to meet the WHO 2030 cervical cancer elimination program, evaluation and utilization of sensitive testing method, and feasible sampling technique is a paradigm for enhancing cervical cancer screening coverage. Self-sampling for screening of HPV DNA testing is one of the easiest and sensitive techniques, though the evidence was limited in the Ethiopian context. This study aimed to compare the performance of self-collected vaginal specimen versus clinician collected cervical specimen for detection of HPV among HIV positive women in Ethiopia. Method(s): We conducted a comparative cross-sectional study design to collect cervicovaginal specimens among HIV positive women of age older than 24 years. Data were collected from six government hospitals from January to October 2021. A total of 994 cervicovaginal specimens was collected by clinicians and HIV positive women themselves in the cervical cancer screening unit using Abbott Cervi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit, and molecular HPV testing was conducted. Data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Sensitivity, specificity and kappa were reported with p < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. Result(s): The prevalence of high-risk HPV was 29.4% among self-sampled specimen and 23.9% among clinician collected specimens. The overall concordance of the test result was 87.3%. Oncogenic HPV types, other than HPV16&18 were predominant in both sampling techniques, 19.9% from vaginal self-collected specimen and 16.7% of clinician collected cervical specimens. The sensitivity and specificity of self-sampled HPV test was 84.0% and 88.4%, respectively. The level of agreement was good (k = 0.68) and statistically significant (p < 0.001). The discriminatory power of the test as true positive and negative was excellent with an area under the curve of 0.86. Conclusion(s): The magnitude of oncogenic HPV was higher in self-collected samples than the clinician collected specimen with good agreement between the two sampling methods. Thus, we recommend the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia to expand utilization of the self-sampled technique and enhance the coverage of screening in the country.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - To evaluate the risk of false HPV-negative results and possible related morphological abnormalities in HPV primary cervical cancer screening. Out of 53,661 HPV-negative cases, 5469 (10.2%) randomly selected cytology slides were evaluated as a part of the quality assurance protocol. The Bethesda category negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) in the HPV-negative cases given was present in 95.4%. Due to cytology other than NILM, 0.4% of cases were referred to colposcopy and 4.2% to the follow-up in one year. In the follow-up HPV negativity and NILM cytology was present in 88.3% of attended women. Cases other than HPV negative and NILM were referred to colposcopy. One biopsy-proven histological HSIL was found in the first round and one in follow-up screening. More comprehensive genotyping of HSIL cases revealed genotypes 69 and 11. Only two HPV test negative cases with histological HSIL were revealed forming 0.04% of quality control group. In both cases, HPV genotype not included in screening tests was found. According to the results, the primary HPV test with cytology triage is an efficient and specific method for cervical cancer screening despite of the fact that some non-high-risk genotypes are missed.

AB  - Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are cancers with generally poor prognosis. Outcomes have not improved in decades, with more than half of the patients presenting with lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis. A unique subtype of HNSCC, cancer of unknown primary of the head and neck (HNCUP) is associated with a poor outcome. Increased expression of the D2-40 gene (podoplanin) has been described for several human malignancies and has been associated with increased metastatic potential of cancer cells. Method(s): In order to examine the role of podoplanin in lymph node metastasis of HNSCC generally and HNCUP specifically, we evaluated the prognostic impact of podoplanin expression in HNSCC- (n = 68) and HNCUP-associated lymph node metastases (n = 30). The expression of podoplanin was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of lymph node tissue samples and correlated with clinical and histopathological data. Result(s): We found a non-significant tendency towards a higher podoplanin expression in HNCUP compared to HNSCC lymph node metastases and a significant correlation between a high podoplanin expression and advanced node-stage classification. Podoplanin expression had no significant impact on overall survival for both groups and did not correlate with human papillomavirus tumor status. Conclusion(s): Taken together, our results suggest that upregulation of podoplanin may be associated with a stimulation of lymphatic metastasis in head and neck cancer.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common and health-threatening cancers in men worldwide. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered one of the organisms with the potential to be involved in the progression of this cancer. In the present study, we evaluated the association between the expression levels of HPV genes with the expression of selected cellular miRNAs (miR-19a, miR-21, miR-23b, miR-34a, miR-150-5p, and miR-155) and their targets genes (P53, Rb, c-Myc, TIMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, PDCD4, Bcl-2, and Survivin) in PCa tissue samples. METHODS: HPV detection and genotyping were performed on the tissues of 112 PCa patients and 39 healthy individuals. The expression profile of miRNA was evaluated by SYBR Green-based real-time PCR. As well Human Survivin ELISA Kit was utilized to determine the concentrations of Retinoblastoma, P53, survivin, Bcl-2, c-Myc, TIMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and PDCD4 in the prostate tissues. RESULTS: According to our findings, HPV genome was detected in 28.7% (21/73) of PCa tissue specimens and 17.94% (7/39) control samples. There was no significant association between the presence of HPV infection with PCa (OR = 2.01, 95%CI = 0.8-5.68, P = 0.102). We found that mean expression level of miR-19a (3.7 +/- 4.3, p-value: 0.0007), and -21 (2.5 +/- 2.8, p-value<0.0001) were significantly higher and miR-23b (-2.14 +/- 3.08, p-value: 0.003) and -34a (-3.12 +/- 3.28, p-value: 0.0001) levels were significantly lower in PCa tissue samples than in control tissue samples. CONCLUSION: Present research indicated that HPV positive PCa has a distinct miRNA profile compared with HPV negative PCa.

AB  - Infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) causes genetic alterations in host cervical cells with consequent changes in gene expression affecting downstream molecular pathways, leading to the development of cervical cancer. In this exploratory study, we aimed to identify the perturbed cellular pathways during the various stages of cervical carcinogenesis. Total RNA was extracted from three formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples each of normal cervix, HPV-infected low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade SIL (HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Gene expression profiling was performed using the 770-gene panel from NanoString nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significantly associated pathways in each stage of cervical cancer development. We identified 121 DEGs involved in cervical carcinogenesis. In the transformation from normal cells to LSIL, the MAPK, transcriptional misregulation and JAK-STAT pathways are implicated, while IL1B may promote inflammation and indirectly activates MMP9, resulting in collagen breakdown and cell migration. The cell cycle - apoptosis pathway with upregulation of E2F1 and MCM2, and DNA repair genes BRCA2-BRIP1 and FANCA are crucial during the progression from LSIL to HSIL. In the final stage of progression to SCC, the cell cycle and signaling pathways, as well as upregulation of c-MYC appear essential. In conclusion, archived FFPE-derived tissue samples are a valuable resource for gene expression profiling. The postulated dysregulated pathways and genes provide a guide of the molecular mechanisms that may be involved in the development of HPV-associated cervical cancer, for further investigation and validation studies.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Infection by high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs), including HPV type 16 (HPV16), is a major risk factor for oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). However, the pathogenic mechanism by which hrHPVs promote oral carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that the suppression of a transporter associated with the antigen-processing complex (TAPs; TAP1 and TAP2), which is a key molecule in the transportation of viral antigenic peptides into MHC class-I cells, is affected by the E6 protein of HPV16. Mechanistically, HPV-mediated immune evasion is principally mediated via the signal-transduction network of a lymphotoxin (LT) pathway, in particular LTalpha1 beta2 and LTbetaR. Our analysis of transcriptomic data from an HNSCC cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicated that expression of TAP genes, particularly TAP2, was downregulated in HPV-infected cases. We further demonstrated that LTalpha1 beta2 and LTbetaR were upregulated, which was negatively correlated with TAP1 and TAP2 expression in HPV-positive clinical OSCC samples. Taken together, our findings imply that HPV16 E6 regulates the machinery of the antigenic peptide-loading system and helps to clarify the role of oncogenic viruses in the context of oral carcinoma.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The prevalence of Merkel cell polyomavirus(MCPyV) in Merkel cell carcinoma(MCC) and non-MCC skin lesions and its possible role in the etiology of other skin diseases remain controversial. To systematically assess the association between MCPyV infection and MCC, non-MCC skin lesions, and normal skin. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search for eligible studies was conducted using Medline Ovid, Pubmed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane CENTRAL databases until August 2021; references were searched to identify additional studies. Observational studies that investigated the association between MCPyV infection and MCC, non-MCC skin lesions, and normal skin using polymerase chain reaction(PCR) as a detection method and provided sufficient data to calculate the prevalence of MCPyV positivity. A total of 50 articles were included in the study after exclusion criteria were applied. Two reviewers independently reviewed and assessed the eligibility of the studies, and all disagreements were resolved by consensus. To determine the association between MCPyV and MCC, overall odds ratio (OR) were calculated with 95% CI using a random-effects model. Single-arm meta-analyses were performed to examine the prevalence rate of MCPyV+ in MCC, non-MCC skin lesions, and normal skin. The primary analysis was the prevalence rate of MCPyV+ in MCC. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence rate of MCPyV+ in non-MCC skin lesions and normal skin. A total of 50 studies involving 5428 patients were reviewed based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Compared with the control group, MCPyV infection was significantly associated with MCC (OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 2.96 - 4.05). The global prevalence of MCPyV+ in MCC, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, keratoacanthoma, seborrheic keratosis, and normal skin was 80%, 4%, 15%, 15%, 21%, 6%, 20%, 10%, and 11%, respectively. The current results suggest that MCPyV infection is significantly associated with an increased risk of MCC. However, the low prevalence rate of MCPyV+ in non-MCC skin lesions does not exclude a pathogenic association of this virus with the development of non-MCC skin lesions.Copyright © 2022 Wijaya, Liu, Qing and Li.

AB  - Background: Topical photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) is a non-invasive option for treatment of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN). We investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of ALA-PDT in treatment of patients with cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and evaluated the factors that effect the efficacy of PDT. Method(s): A total of 99 patients (average age: 30 years (18-45 years old)) with cervical HSIL and high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (hr-HPV) infections and who had received ALA-PDT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Before ALA-PDT, cervical exfoliated cells from all patients were obtained for HPV genotyping, liquid-based cytology test (LBC) and PAX1 methylation (PAX1m) test. Then, 6 months after ALA-PDT, HPV genotyping, LBC and colposcopy-directed biopsy were conducted. During subsequent follow-up, HPV genotyping and LBC were performed, and colposcopy-directed biopsy was conducted if hr-HPV was positive and/or LBC result was abnormal. Result(s): At 6 months after treatment, total HPV clearance and lesions complete remission (CR) rates were 64.6% (64/99) and 88.9% (88/99), while at 1-year of follow-up, they were 81.3% (65/80) and 92.5% (74/80), respectively. At 1-year follow-up, HPV clearance rate was higher, relative to 6 months after ALA-PDT (p <0.05). At 6 months after treatment, HPV clearance and CR rates in the PAX1 hypermethylation (PAX1hm) group were 36.8% and 73.7%, which were lower compared to the rates for PAX1 hypomethylation (PAX1lm) group (71.3%, 92.5%) (p <0.05). Moreover, of the 11 patients with cervical canal lesions, 3 (3/7, 42.9%) patients had cervical canal HSIL persistence and the other 4 cervical canal HSIL and all of the 4 cervical canal LSIL had complete remission. Conclusion(s): ALA-PDT is an effective, safe treatment approach for patients with cervical HSIL and hr-HPV infections. Patients with PAX1lm showed better therapeutic outcomes than patients with PAX1hm or cervical canal HSIL.Copyright © 2022

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal quantification of PET in assessment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still under development. The effect of partial volume correction (PVC) on the evaluation of survival in the HNSCC patients has not been investigated yet. METHODOLOGY: Pretreatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans of a selected group of 57 patients with advanced stage HNSCC were collected. Conventional (SUVmean and SUVmax) and volumetric [total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV)] PET metrics were calculated. The ROVER software (ABX GmbH, Radeberg, Germany) automatically applied PVC to the PET metrics. Cox proportional hazards regression model calculated hazard ratio (HR) for assessment of predictive parameters of progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: In multivariate Cox regression analysis, including age, gender, race, human papillomavirus status, and stage, the only significant predictors of PFS were the volumetric PET parameters (TLG: HR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005; P = 0.02), pvcTLG (HR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004; P = 0.01) and MTV (HR, 1.050; 95% CI, 1.024-1.077; P < 0.01). The partial volume-corrected values were significantly higher than the noncorrected values (Wilcoxon sign test; P < 0.05). However, there was not a statistically significant difference between the nonpartial volume corrected and partial volume-corrected PET metrics for assessment of PFS. CONCLUSION: Volumetric PET metrics were predictors of PFS in Cox regression analysis. Applying PVC could not significantly improve the accuracy of PET metrics for assessment of PFS.

AB  - Background: A diversity of microorganisms is associated with human health and exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium. This diversity has direct implications for the assessment of susceptibility to infectious diseases, especially human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Method(s): Here, we investigated the relationships between HPV infection and vaginal, cervical, and gut microbiota composition and assessed the levels of genital immune mediators. We selected a multiethnic area in Yunnan Province, China, to collect samples from healthy women of childbearing age. A total of 82 healthy women of childbearing age were included in this study. Vaginal, cervical, and rectal swabs were collected to analyze the microbial community, and cytokines were analyzed in some samples. Finding(s): Different proportions and types of HPV infection were detected in cervical (44%), vaginal (18%), and rectal (18%) swabs. HPV detected in cervical swabs was generally a high-risk type, while low-risk HPV types were primarily detected in vaginal and rectal swabs. There were some differences in this proportion as well as in the microbial community composition among different ethnic groups. Rectal samples exhibited the highest diversity index, while vaginal samples displayed the lowest diversity index. Lactobacillus dominated most of the vaginal samples, was decreased in HPV-positive samples, and differed among different ethnic groups. However, the sequence proportion of Lactobacillus in the cervix exhibited the opposite trend in those affected by HPV infection. The dynamic balance between the potential pathogens Gardnerella and Lactobacillus determines the health of the female genital system. Interpretation(s): This study constitutes the first step toward personalized medicine for women's reproductive health, wherein differences between the genital microbiomes of individuals would be considered in risk assessment and for subsequent disease diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Xiao, Fang, Dong, Ye, He, Wang, Li, Zhao, Yuan, Zhao, He, Zhang, Yang, Wu and Li.

When severe or recurrent infections and exceedingly elevated serum IgE levels occur in AD patients, an inborn error of immunity (IEI) may be suspected. The International Union of Immunological Societies classification lists variants in different genes responsible for so-called Hyper-IgE syndromes. Diagnosing an underlying IEI may influence treatment strategies. Method(s): Clinical and diagnostic workup of family members are presented including a detailed immunological description and histology of the carcinoma. Functional testing of the novel variant in CARD11 underlying 'CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-kB signaling' (CADINS) was performed. Result(s): We report on an 18-year-old patient with a long-standing history of infections, accompanied by hypogammaglobulinemia, intermittent agranulocytosis, atopy, eosinophilia and colitis. The working diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency was revised when a novel heterozygous CARD11 variant [c.223C>T; p.(Arg75Trp)] was identified. Functional studies confirmed this variant to have a dominant negative (DN) effect, as previously described in patients with CADINS. Five other family members were affected by severe atopy associated with the above variant, but not hypogammaglobulinemia. Malignancies occurred in two generations: an HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma and a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. So far, one patient is under treatment with dupilumab, which has shown marked benefit in controlling severe eczema. Conclusion(s): The phenotypic spectrum associated with heterozygous CARD11 DN mutations is broad. Partial T-cell deficiency, diminished IFN-gamma cytokine and increased IL-4 production, were identified as disease-causing mechanisms. Malignant disease associated with germline CARD11 DN variants has only been reported sporadically. HPV vaccination in teenage years, and cytology screening analogous with routine cervical swabs may be recommended. Treatment with dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking interleukin-4- and interleukin-13 signaling, may be of benefit in controlling severe and extended AD for some patients as reported for STAT3 loss-of-function.Copyright © 2022 Pietzsch, Korholz, Boschann, Sergon, Dorjbal, Yee, Gilly, Kammerer, Paul, Kastl, Laass, Berner, Jacobsen, Roesler, Aust, Lee-Kirsch, Snow and Schuetz.

AB  - Bowen's disease (BD) is an intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with the capacity to become invasive SCC giving rise to distant metastasis. In rare cases it can be associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, specifically with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 32, and 34. Here we report a case of an immunocompetent white male, age 37, with an erythematous, irregularly-shaped patch in his suprapubic region, appearing 1 year after treatment for condylomata acuminata with cryotherapy and podophyllin in the same area. At the time of clinically active disease, a urethral smear was positive for high-risk HPV types. The lesion was considered a scar by several physicians because it emerged in an area of previous postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. The aim of this report is to raise awareness of the emerging causative association between anogenital HPV infection and the development of BD, which was the possible etiological agent in the case of the patient presented here. Hereby we also advocate primary preventive measures in terms of safe sexual habits and HPV vaccination.Copyright © 2022, Slovene Medical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Radiotherapy is a definitive treatment for early-stage cervical cancer; however, a subset of this disease recurs locally, necessitating establishment of predictive biomarkers and treatment strategies. To address this issue, we performed gene panel-based sequencing of 18 stage IB cervical cancers treated with definitive radiotherapy, including two cases of local recurrence, followed by in vitro and in silico analyses. Simultaneous mutations in KRAS and SMAD4 (KRASmt/SMAD4mt) were detected only in a local recurrence case, indicating potential association of this mutation signature with radioresistance. In isogenic cell-based experiments, a combination of activating KRAS mutation and SMAD4 deficiency led to X-ray resistance, whereas either of these factors alone did not. Analysis of genomic data from 55,308 cancers showed a significant trend toward co-occurrence of mutations in KRAS and SMAD4. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset suggested upregulation of the pathways involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition and inflammatory responses in KRASmt/SMAD4mt cancer cells. Notably, irradiation with thera-peutic carbon ions led to robust killing of X-ray-resistant KRASmt/SMAD4mt cancer cells. These data indicate that the KRASmt/SMAD4mt signature is a potential predictor of radioresistance, and that carbon ion radiotherapy is a potential option to treat early-stage cervical cancers with the KRASmt/SMAD4mt signature.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose Bintrafusp alfa is a bifunctional agent consisting of an anti-human PD-L1 antibody linked to two TGFbetaRII. It is designed to act both as a checkpoint inhibitor and to trap' TGFbeta in the tumor microenvironment. Phase I and II clinical studies demonstrated clinical activity in patients with a range of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. The purpose of the studies reported here was the interrogation of various aspects of the peripheral immunome in patients with HPV-associated cancers, both prior to and early in the treatment regimen of bintrafusp alfa to better understand the mode of action of the agent and to help define which patients are more likely to benefit from bintrafusp alfa treatment. Patients and methods The peripheral immunome of patients (n=65) with HPV + malignancies was analyzed both prior to treatment with bintrafusp alfa and day 14 post-treatment for levels and changes in (1) 158 different immune cell subsets, (2) multiple plasma soluble factors including analytes reflecting immune stimulatory and inhibitory status, (3) complete blood counts, and in a subset of patients (4) TCR diversity and (5) HPV-specific T-cell responses. Results Interrogation of the peripheral immunome prior to bintrafusp alfa treatment revealed several factors that associated with clinical response, including (1) higher levels of sCD27:sCD40L ratios, (2) lower levels of TGFbeta1 and 12 additional factors associated with tumor mesenchymalization, and (3) higher CD8 + T cell:MDSC ratios. Analysis at 2 weeks post bintrafusp alfa revealed that eventual clinical responders had fewer increases in IL-8 levels and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and higher levels of HPV-16 specific CD8 + T cells. This study also provided information concerning differences in the peripheral immunome for patients who were naive versus refractory to prior checkpoint inhibition therapy. While preliminary, two multivariate models developed predicted clinical benefit with 76%-91% accuracy. Conclusions These studies add insight into the mechanism of action of bintrafusp alfa and provide evidence that the interrogation of both cellular and soluble components of the peripheral immunome of patients with HPV-associated malignancies, either prior to or early in the therapeutic regimen, can provide information as to which patients are more likely to benefit with bintrafusp alfa therapy.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - A dramatic increase in cervical diseases associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV) in women of reproductive age has been observed over the past decades. An accurate differential diagnosis of the severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and the choice of the optimal treatment requires the search for effective biomarkers with high diagnostic and prognostic value. The objective of this study was to introduce a method for rapid shotgun lipidomics to differentiate stages of HPV-associated cervix epithelium transformation. Tissue samples from 110 HPV-positive women with cervicitis (n = 30), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (n = 30), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) (n = 30), and cervical cancers (n = 20) were obtained. The cervical epithelial tissue lipidome at different stages of cervix neoplastic transformation was studied by a shotgun label-free approach. It is based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data of a tissue extract. Lipidomic data were processed by the orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to build statistical models, differentiating stages of cervix transformation. Significant differences in the lipid profile between the lesion and surrounding tissues were revealed in chronic cervicitis, LSIL, HSIL, and cervical cancer. The lipids specific for HPV-induced cervical transformation mainly belong to glycerophospholipids: phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines. The developed diagnostic OPLS-DA models were based on 23 marker lipids. More than 90% of these marker lipids positively correlated with the degree of cervix transformation. The algorithm was developed for the management of patients with HPV-associated diseases of the cervix, based on the panel of 23 lipids as a result. ESI-MS analysis of a lipid extract by direct injection through a loop, takes about 25 min (including preparation of the lipid extract), which is significantly less than the time required for the HPV test (several hours for hybrid capture and about an hour for PCR). This makes lipid mass spectrometric analysis a promising method for express diagnostics of HPV-associated neoplastic diseases of the cervix.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and HPV 18 account for 75% of all cervical cancers. The L1 gene, encoding the major surface protein (MSP), is used to classify HPV types (lineages and sublineages), genotypes, and intratypic variants. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the lineages, sublineages, genetic variabilities, and mutation effects on transcription factor binding sites by using partial sequences of the HPV 16 and HPV 18 long control regions (LCRs) in these samples. Materials and Methods. After DNA isolation from 56 positive samples, the LCR of HPV 16 and HPV 18 were amplified using specific primers, and phylogenetic trees were drawn through MEGA X. Compared to the reference sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The transcription binding sites were also evaluated using the online PROMO database. Results. The LCRs of 52 samples were successfully sequenced. Overall, 81.58% of all HPV 16 variants belonged to the D1 sublineage, followed by A4 (13.16%), A1 (2.63%), and C1 (2.63%) sublineages. All HPV 18 isolates belonged to A sublineage, 92.85% to A3 sublineage, and 7.15% to A4 sublineage. Out of 27 SNPs in the HPV 16 LCR, A7382T, T7384G, C7387T, C7393G, A7431G, T7448C, and C7783A were HPV 16-specific. Also, among 14 SNPs in the HPV 18 LCR, C7577A and A7943T were not previously reported. An insertion (C) between 7432 and 7433 positions was identified in all studied HPV 16 variants. Besides, most of the HPV 16 mutations were embedded in the YY1, TFIID, Oct-2, and NF-1 binding sites, while c-Fos and MBF1, as the most common binding sites, were affected by HPV 18 LCR mutations. Conclusion. The present results showed that D1 and A3 were the dominant sublineages of HPV 16 and HPV 18, respectively. Therefore, women infected with these variants need to be examined in further longitudinal studies to obtain more information about the oncogenic potential of these dominant variants in Iran.

AB  - Treatment success of head and neck cancer (HNC) is still hampered by tumor relapse due to metastases. Our study aimed to identify biomarkers by exploiting transcriptomics profiles of patient-matched metastases, primary tumors, and normal tissue mucosa as well as the TCGA HNC cohort data sets. Analyses identified osteoblast-specific factor 2 (OSF-2) as significantly overexpressed in lymph node metastases and primary tumors compared to normal tissue. High OSF-2 levels correlate with metastatic disease and reduced overall survival of predominantly HPV-negative HNC patients. No significant correlation was observed with tumor localization or therapy response.These findings were supported by the fact that OSF-2 expression was not elevated in cisplatin-resistant HNC cell lines. OSF-2 was strongly expressed in tumor-associated fibroblasts, suggesting a tumor microenvironment-promoting function. Molecular cloning and expression studies of OSF-2 variants from patients identified an evolutionary conserved bona fide protein secretion signal (1MIPFLPMFSLLLLLIVNPINA21). OSF-2 enhanced cell migration and cellular survival under stress conditions, which could be mimicked by the extracellular administration of recombinant protein. Here, OSF-2 executes its functions via s1 integrin, resulting in the phosphorylation of PI3K and activation of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway. Collectively, we suggest OSF-2 as a potential prognostic biomarker and drug target, promoting metastases by supporting the tumor microenvironment and lymph node metastases survival rather than by enhancing primary tumor proliferation or therapy resistance.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is generally low, with the likelihood of locoregional recurrence or disease progression (LR/DP). Knowledge of prognostic factors for survival is key to achieving an understanding and increased survival. The present study aimed to identify prognostic factors for patients with OSCC, especially the presence of DNA from human papillomavirus (HPV). Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective cohort study including 119 patients with OSCC treated at the National Cancer Institute in Mexico City (2009-2013). Clinical information was obtained from patient records including LR/DP. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained and used for detecting DNA from different types of HPV. Potential prognostic factors for Overall Survival (OS) were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Result(s): After model adjustment, factors associated with longer OS were a pre-treatment platelet count above 400,000/mm3 (HR=0.09, p=0.026) and response to primary treatment (HR=0.26, p=0.001). HPV DNA was pres ent in 23 (19.3%) of the patients and importantly, type 16 found in 19 of them. Although survival of HPV-positive patients was longer, difference was not significant. However, among patients with LR/DP, HPV positivity was significantly associated with increased survival (HR=0.23, p=0.034). Importantly, survival was significantly different for HPV-positive patients with LR/DP > 6 months (HR=0.20, p=0.002), had higher absolute lymphocyte count at start of treatment (HR=0.50, p=0.028) or had local rescue treatment (HR=0.24, p=0.019). Conclusion(s): Although HPV positivity was not associated with a longer OS of OSCC patients, a better prognosis was significantly associated with HPV positivity and recurring or progressing disease, particularly with HPV type 16.Copyright © 2022, Medicina Oral S.L..

AB  - Background/Aim: Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy among women in Vietnam, but the country is yet to introduce a national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine programme targeted at adolescents. We determined HPV prevalence and HPV vaccine knowledge among female university students in Vietnam. Patients and Methods: We surveyed and screened 1,491 female university students in Hanoi, Hue, and Ho Chi Minh City for their sexual behaviours, HPV knowledge and low- and high-risk HPV infection. Result(s): The prevalence of any HPV infection and any high-risk HPV infection were 4.2% (95%CI=3.3%-5.4%) and 3.4% (95%CI=2.5%-4.4%), respectively. Being sexually active [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 6.22; 95%CI=3.4-11.37] and having ever been pregnant (aPR: 4.82; 95%CI=1.93-12.04) were positively associated with high-risk HPV infection. Whilst 60% of participants had heard of HPV vaccine, only 4.6% had received the vaccine. Conclusion(s): The low HPV prevalence found in university students in Vietnam indicates that they can benefit from HPV vaccination, along with a well-designed HPV health promotion programme.Copyright © 2022 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

AB  - Background: Treatment of locally advanced HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with photon radiation is the standard of care but shows only moderate success. Alterations in response toward DNA DSB repair, apoptosis, and senescence are underlying determinants of radioresistance in the tumor cells. Recently, senescence and the associated secretory phenotype (SASP) came into the focus of research and raised the need to identify the tumor-promoting molecular mechanisms of the SASP. The aim of this project was to unravel more of this process and to understand the impact of the IL1 pathway, which plays a major role in SASP. The studies were performed for photon and 12C-ion irradiation, which strongly vary in their effect on radioresistance. Material(s) and Method(s): A panel of five HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines was treated with photon and 12C-ion irradiation and examined for clonogenic survival, DNA DSB repair, and senescence. SASP and IL1 gene expressions were determined by RNA sequencing and activation of the IL1 pathway by ELISA. A functional impact of IL1A and IL1B was examined by specific siRNA knockdown. Result(s): Cell killing and residual DSBs were higher after 12C-ion than after photon irradiation. 12C-ion induced more senescence with a significant correlation with cell survival. The impact on radioresistance appears to be less than after photon irradiation. The expression of SASP-related genes and the IL1 pathway are strongly induced by both types of irradiation and correlate with radioresistance and senescence, especially IL1A and IL1B which exhibit excellent associations. Surprisingly, knockdown of IL1A and IL1B revealed that the IL1 pathway is functionally not involved in radioresistance, DSB repair, or induction of senescence. Conclusion(s): IL1A and IL1B are excellent indicators of cellular radioresistance and senescence in HNSCC cells without functional involvement in these processes. Clearly more research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of senescence and SASP and its impact on radioresistance.Copyright © 2022 Tiwari, Hannen, Unger, Kohl, Hes, Lauber, Subtil, Dikomey, Engenhart-Cabillic and Schotz.

AB  - Patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy are reassessed both radiologically and clinically to adapt their treatment after the first cycle. However, some responders show early tumor progression after adjuvant radiotherapy. This cohort study evaluated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a population of locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) induction chemotherapy or DCF with a modified dose and fractioned administration. The counts and phenotypes of CTCs were assessed at baseline and at day 21 of treatment, after isolation using the RosetteSepTM technique based on negative enrichment. At baseline, 6 out of 21 patients had CTCs (28.6%). On day 21, 5 out of 11 patients had CTCs (41.6%). There was no significant difference in the overall and progression-free survival between patients with or without CTCs at baseline (p = 0.44 and 0.78) or day 21 (p = 0.88 and 0.5). Out of the 11 patients tested at day 21, 4 had a positive variation of CTCs (33%). Patients with a positive variation of CTCs display a lower overall survival. Our findings suggest that the variation in the number of CTCs would be a better guide to the management of treatment, with possible early changes in treatment strategy.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers are increasingly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Previous studies of oral HPV indicate considerable heterogeneity across geographic regions and by sex, but studies differ in methodologies used and risk groups included. Understanding the natural history of oral HPV in the general population is important to assess HPV-related disease burden and plan effective prevention programs. In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence, incidence, and persistence of oral HPV among adult men and women. Factors independently associated with oral HPV will also be evaluated. METHODS: The PROGRESS (PRevalence of Oral hpv infection, a Global aSSessment) study is a non-interventional study of 7877 healthy men and women aged 18-60 years, from France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). Oral HPV prevalence will be measured using a commercially available PCR DNA test. In the US, participants will be followed prospectively every 6 months for 24 months to assess incidence, clearance, and persistence of oral HPV infection. Eligible individuals presenting for regular dental check-ups will be recruited from participating dental offices via systematic consecutive sampling. Participant dentists will collect clinical characteristics, and participants will complete self-reported study questionnaires and provide an oral rinse and gargle (ORG) specimen for HPV-DNA detection and genotyping at each study visit. HPV-DNA detection and genotyping will be performed in two reference laboratories, using the SPF10/DEIA/LiPA25 system. DISCUSSION: PROGRESS study aims to fill knowledge gaps concerning the natural history of oral HPV using a standardized methodology. PROGRESS will also assess factors associated with oral HPV prevalence and natural history in the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an important risk factor for a subset of head and neck cancers (HNCs). However, estimates of the HPV-attributable fraction of oropharyngeal cancers vary greatly, and the proportion is increasing. Growing evidence indicates smaller proportions of oral cavity and laryngeal cancers are also HPV-attributable, but this requires further investigation. The primary objective of the BROADEN study is to estimate the fraction of HNCs attributable to HPV in selected European and Asian countries by anatomic site. Secondary objectives are to determine HPV genotypes involved and to describe primary tumor and patient characteristics by HPV status. METHODS: BROADEN is a non-interventional, cross-sectional study of patients with HNC in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and Spain. The HPV-attributable HNC fraction will be determined within pre-defined time-periods (2008-2009, 2013-2014 [China only], 2018-2019). Approximately 9000 patients from an estimated 90 hospitals with reference HNC diagnostic units and local reference pathology laboratories will participate. Sample size estimates were generated by grouped anatomic site (oropharynx, oral cavity, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx) and country. HPV testing (HPV-DNA and p16 immunohistochemistry [IHC]) will be performed at a central laboratory on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. All HPV-DNA-positive samples and HPV-DNA-negative/p16 IHC-positive samples, plus 10% of remaining HPV DNA-negative (control) samples will be tested for HPV mRNA. DISCUSSION: BROADEN is a large global epidemiologic study to estimate current and recent past HPV burden in oropharyngeal and non-oropharyngeal HNCs. BROADEN is expected to provide robust estimates of HPV attributability by anatomic site in participating countries.

AB  - Spitz neoplasms, according to 2018 WHO Blue Book, are morphologically defined by spindled and/or epithelioid melanocytes and genetically by either HRAS mutations or kinase gene fusions. The terminology "spitzoid" refers to lesions with similar morphology but with alternate or undefined genetic anomalies. Herein, we present 3 melanocytic neoplasms with a spitzoid cytomorphology, variable nuclear atypia, and harboring undescribed fusions involving RASGRF1. Two cases presented as unpigmented papules on the heel of a 26-year-old female (case 1) and the forearm of a 13-year-old boy (case 2). They were classified as low-grade melanocytomas (WHO 2018). The third case appeared as a pigmented ulcer on the sole of a 72-year-old female (case 3) that displayed diagnostic features of an invasive melanoma (Breslow thickness 6 mm, Clark level V). A wide skin reexcision identified an epidermotropic metastasis, and sentinel lymph node biopsy displayed multiple subcapsular metastatic deposits. RNA sequencing revealed CD63::RASGRF1, EHBP1::RASGRF1, and ABCC2::RASGRF1 fusions in cases 1 to 3, respectively. They were confirmed by a RASGRF1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. Translocations of RASGRF1, a gene coding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor but not a kinase, have rarely been reported in tumors. While all these cases showed spitzoid cytomorphology, it is too early to tell if they are true Spitz neoplasms as currently defined.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer (HNSCC) with a disease-free survival at 3 years that does not exceed 30%. Biomarkers able to predict clinical outcomes are clearly needed. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a short-term culture of tumour fragments irradiated ex vivo could anticipate patient responses to chemo-and/or radiotherapies. Biopsies were collected prior to treatment from a cohort of 28 patients with non-operable tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx, and then cultured ex vivo. Short-term biopsy slice culture is a robust method that keeps cells viable for 7 days. Different biomarkers involved in the stemness status (CD44) or the DNA damage response (pATM and gamma-H2AX) were investigated for their potential to predict the treatment response. A higher expression of all these markers was predictive of a poor response to treatment. This allowed the stratification of responder or non-responder patients to treatment. Moreover, the ratio for the expression of the three markers 24 h after 4 Gy irradiation versus 0 Gy was higher in responder than in non-responder patients. Finally, combining these biomarkers greatly improved their predictive potential, especially when the gamma-H2AX ratio was associated with the CD44 ratio or the pATM ratio. These results encourage further evaluation of these biomarkers in a larger cohort of patients.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been used to prevent chronic HPV infection, which accounts for cervical cancer. Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) conducted an HPV vaccination campaign in 2010 and the Obstetrical Gynecological Society of Osaka initiated a multicenter, prospective cohort study in Osaka, Japan-OCEAN (Osaka Clinical resEArch of HPV vacciNe) study-to investigate the oncogenic HPV prevalence and the long-term protection rate of HPV vaccine. A total of 2814 participants were enrolled on their visit for HPV vaccination between 12 and 18 years old. Among them, 102 participants received HPV/Pap co-test as primary cancer screening at the age of 20-21. We compared the prevalence in two groups (the vaccinated and the unvaccinated group). HPV infection ratio was significantly lower in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated (12.9% vs. 19.7%; p = .04). In particular, HPV 16 and 18 were not detected in the vaccinated group, while 4.9% of participants in the unvaccinated group were infected (p = .001), suggesting that vaccination provided effective protection against high-risk types of HPV. The cross-protection effect of HPV vaccines was also observed against HPV 31, 45, and 52. Although HPV vaccines were not contributed to the reduction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN) (p = .28), CIN2 or worse was not observed in vaccinated group. Our research showed that at the age of 20-21, HPV vaccine inhibited the infection of high-risk HPV and had impacted on the development to CIN2 or worse in Japan.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is one of the most important cause of developing cervical cancer. Therefore, effective epitope-based vaccine design for HPV-16 would be of major medical benefit. The aim of our study was to identify B- and T-cell epitopes of HPV-16 L1 protein. In this study, the HPV-16 L1 gene was isolated from HPV recovered from five vaginal swab samples using specific primers and finally sequenced. The ExPASy translate tool (http://web.expasy.org/translate/) was used to convert nucleotide sequence into amino acid sequence. Bioinformatic analysis was employed to predict suitable B- and T-cell epitopes and immunogenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity of predicted epitopes were then evaluated. Afterward, the selected T-cell epitopes were docked using Molegro Virtual Docker software. The two epitopes 207AMDFTTLQA215 and 200MVDTGFGAM208 have showed a very strong binding affinity to HLA-A0201 and HLA-B3501 molecules, respectively. Outcome of B-cell epitope prediction showed that epitope 475KAKPKFTLGKRK ATPTTSSTSTTAKRKK502 contained overlapped epitope, which might be the epitope associated with the production of neutralizing antibody response. Based on this finding, the predicted B- and T-cell epitopes are promising targets for epitope-based vaccine development against HPV-16. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CINtec((R)) PLUS p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology (DS) is an alternative test to cytology in triaging human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women. Dalton p16/Ki-67 Dual Stain kit employs the similar immunocytochemical detection and operating procedures with CINtec((R)) PLUS, but its accuracy and efficacy in triaging HPV-positive women need to be evaluated. METHODS: A total of 717 HPV-positive specimens of cervical exfoliated cells were included. Cytology, Dalton, and CINtec((R)) PLUS were subsequently performed, and two DS tests were separately completed in each of the same specimens. The results of two DS tests were head-to-head compared, and their efficacies to identify high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were evaluated, using histopathology of biopsy as the golden standard. RESULTS: The overall positive rate of two DS tests were 28.31% for Dalton and 33.89% for CINtec((R)) PLUS (p < 0.05); both rose with the increased severity of histopathological and cytological abnormalities. Compared to CINtec((R)) PLUS, the positive rate of Dalton was significantly lower in the normal histopathology group (p < 0.05) and lower, but not significantly, in mild abnormal histopathology and cytology NILM and LSIL groups. Two DS tests showed a good consistency (Kappa value, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.557-0.688), with 100% of consistency in the cytology HSIL group. Inconsistency occurred mainly in the cytology NILM and LSIL groups, with more Dalton negative but CINtec((R)) PLUS positive. Compared to CINtec((R)) PLUS, Dalton showed similar sensitivity (94.59% vs. 91.89%), but significantly higher specificity (75.29% vs. 69.26%, p = 0.013) and accuracy (76.29% vs. 70.43%, p = 0.012), with a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.849 (95% CI, 0.800-0.899) for identifying CIN3+. The similar results were observed when identifying CIN2+. CONCLUSIONS: Dalton presents the lower false positive rate and better efficacy in identifying high-grade CIN than CINtec((R)) PLUS, suggesting that Dalton may be superior to CINtec((R)) PLUS and an alternative technique for triaging primary HPV-positive women in cervical cancer screening.

AB  - Introduction: The follow-up of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) allows us to understand their progression and regression, however squamous cell atypia (ASC) can generate confusing follow-up results. We aimed to describe the evolution of ASC and SIL during cyto-histopathological follow-up in a tertiary-care hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): we conducted a retrospective study during 2016 in 156 Papanicolaou test (PAP) results under three models: 1) with >=1 PAP and biopsies, 2) 1 PAP followed by >=1 biopsy, and 3) >=1 PAP and a confirmatory biopsy. Progression was defined as ASCUS to low-grade SIL (LSIL) or higher, and LSIL to high-grade SIL (HSIL) or higher; and regression as HSIL to LSIL or lower; and LSIL to ASCUS or lower. Result(s): In PAP, 57 (36.5%) cases were ASC and in histopathology 56 (39.9%) cases of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Twenty-nine (18.6%) results were followed: 8 (27.6%), 17 (58.6%), and 4 (13.8%) with models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The progression of the lesions was reported in ~50% for models 2 and 3. ASCUS was the main cytological finding that indicated biopsies, and for all models, the mean progression and regression time was 4 and 3.1 months, respectively. Conclusion(s): The follow-up of cytological alterations in three models showed progression of lesions in half of the cases analyzed with a time of four months of evolution; ASCUS was the main finding that indicated histopathological study.Copyright © 2022 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum.

AB  - Background: Head and neck cancer (HNC) develops due to a number of risk factors, including infection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV). The genetic predisposition also plays an important role in deregulating different signaling pathways including the NF-KB pathway. Certain polymorphisms are reported to affect the NF-kB pathway genes. Objective(s): The present research was conducted to study the association of HPV with NF-KB1 (p50) gene polymorphisms in HNC patients of the Pakistani population. Method(s): Genomic DNA from HNC tumors samples was extracted using the Exgene SV DNA extraction Kit. Allele-specific PCR and direct sequencing were done for analysis of NF-kappaB1 SNPs 94ins/del (rs28362491), rs1598858 and rs4648068. Result(s): The genotypes AGrs1598858, AGrs4648068 and GGrs4648068 were associated with significantly increased risk of head and neck cancer in studied population. Furthermore the HNC cases with genotypes AGrs1598858 and GGrs4648068 displayed growing risk of HPV related cancers. Promotor region SNP 94ins/del (rs28362491) was not detected in studied population. Tobacco use, lymph nodes involvement and poorly differentiated tumors were positively associated with HPV induced cancers. Conclusion(s): It is the first comprehensive study from Pakistan, to evaluate the polymorphic variants of NF-kappaB1. Genotypes AGrs4648068, GGrs4648068, and AGrs1598858 of NF-kappaB1 gene are associated with increased risk of head and neck cancers in the studied HPV infected Pakistani population. It can be concluded that HPV infection, involvement of lymph nodes and tobacco use can act synergetic and add up in modulating HPV induced HNC with intronic SNPs of NF-kappaB1 gene in Pakistani population.Copyright © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Objective: To explore treatment strategies for patients with positive margins after cervical cold knife conization (CKC) by estimating the risk of residual or recurrent CIN2 or worse (CIN2+). Method(s): A retrospective study included 569 patients receiving CKC for CIN3 in Xiangya Hospital from January 2013 to December 2017. Demographic characteristics and test results were obtained before CKC, after CKC, at 6, 12, and 24 months, then annually thereafter. The primary end point was residual/recurrent CIN2+ post-CKC. Result(s): Fourteen (2.46%) patients had residual/recurrent CIN2+ with a median time of occurrence at 12 months post-CKC. Taking the average age and hrHPV viral load tested by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) as thresholds, the risk of residual/recurrent CIN2+ was higher in women aged over 40 years or with a baseline HC2 of 300 or more for the ratio of relative light units to positive cut-off values. Patients with positive margins were at higher risk of residual/recurrent CIN2+ (hazard ratio 3.66, 95% confidence interval 1.25-10.71), especially when endocervix was involved. A total of 536 (94.20%) patients received HPV testing within 6 months after CKC. Patients with both positive HPV testing results and positive margins were at the highest risk of residual/recurrent CIN2+. Conclusion(s): Patients with positive endocervical margins are at high risk for residual/recurrent CIN2+, independent of the severity of margins. HPV testing within 6 months after CKC may be a feasible triage strategy for these patients.Copyright © 2021 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is recognized as a primary etiologic factor of anogenital cancers and more recently of a subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). The incidence of HPV-related OPSCC has increased dramatically in several developed countries in the past 3 decades and is currently the most common cancer caused by HR-HPV in the United States and Germany, surpassing cervical cancer. Consequently, the patient's demographic and clinicopathologic profile has shifted to nonsmoking and nondrinking younger men with higher schooling level and with a history of multiple oral sex partners. Patients with HPV-related OPSCC often show better treatment outcomes and higher survival rates than their HPV-unrelated counterparts, which has led to a change in tumor staging for HPV-related cases. HPV vaccination is emerging as an effective primary prevention strategy, and systematic screening of HPV DNA in blood and salivary oral rinse samples of HR patients is being examined to determine if it may provide a surveillance method and support early diagnosis of HPV-related OPSCC. In this context, a narrative review was conducted to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of HPV-related OPSCC, including epidemiology, risk factors, clinicopathologic and molecular features, screening, prevention, management, and prognosis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction/Background In 2019, 47.7% of all eligible women in Germany participated in cervical cancer screening. Since 2020 screening includes HPV/cytology co-testing from age 35 onwards. Self-sampling for HPV detection could reduce screening barriers and increase participation. Methodology This mixed-methods sub-study of the FACTSproject aimed to focus on experiences of affected women on screening barriers and the potential use of self-sampling in Germany. All women included in the FACTS project (n=696) were asked to perform self-sampling (Evalyn-Brush) in addition to a physician-taken specimen and to fill a questionnaire (n=613). Additionally, 25 semi-structured interviews with different groups of participants were performed. Results 536 women (87.4%) with median age 40 (20-79) had participated in the screening program several times. Most of the interviewed women (n=14) reported that they often do not know what happens at screening or which tests are done. In addition, they experienced structural barriers (i.e. long waiting times, appointment difficulties). 16.3% of all women over 35 years stated they had not yet had an HPV test or could not remember having one. The performance of self-sampling and self-sampling in comparison to a physician-taken smear was described as good or very good by 88.6% and 83.1%, respectively. Importantly, all women interviewed indicated that they would not generally prefer self-sampling to a visit at the gynaecologist. However, self-sampling could provide additional security and a way of not having to extend screening intervals due to time constraints. Conclusion Cervical cancer screening is associated with many barriers. Not knowing which tests will be done and a lack of comprehensible explanations is most likely to lead to uncertainty and seems avoidable. Self-sampling as an option in addition to office-based screening is well accepted among German women and can reduce structural barriers. However, women would not want to replace a visit to the gynaecologist by selfsampling.

AB  - Objectives. Cervical cancer is one of the most common female cancers in Estonia. In order to improve the detection of cervical cancer and precancerous conditions, Estonia switched from cytology-based screening to HPV-based screening of cervical cancer in January 2021. Women aged 30-65 years are invited for screening at five-year intervals. In this study, we evaluate the prevalence of high-risk HPV and its distribution in different age groups among women who have been screened in our hospital. METHODS. The study included all women whose cervical specimens had been tested for high-risk HPV under cervical cancer screening from January 2021 to April 2022 in the laboratory of East-Tallinn Central Hospital. Cervical samples were collected into vials with ThinPrep Preservcyt solution (Hologic, Inc USA). HPV was tested by real-time PCR using the cobas 4800 system (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). The method genotypes HPV16 and HPV18, and detects other 12 high-risk HPV genotypes (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68) as a pool. Results were calculated for the entire study group and separately for 8 different age groups with 5-year intervals according to screening coverage. RESULTS. A total of 7769 women were included. The overall prevalence of high-risk HPV in the study group was 8.3%. The frequency of HPV16 and HPV18 was 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively. The age-specific prevalence was significantly higher in the age groups 30 and 35 years, 14.2% and 10.3%, respectively, and it decreased to 5.7-8.0% in women aged 40-65 years. The prevalence of HPV16 was highest in 30-year-olds, at 3.8%, accounting for 27.2% of all HPV-positive cases in this age group. CONCLUSIONS. The overall prevalence of high-risk HPV among screening patients was approximately as expected from the data of other European countries. The detection rate was highest among the youngest age group, and it decreased with age. Hopefully, future studies will evaluate the benefit of HPV-based screening in our country.

AB  - Background: This study will assess whether setanaxib, an investigational nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) 1/4 inhibitor (Calliditas Therapeutics Suisse SA), could increase cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-rich tumour response to pembrolizumab in patients (pts) with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (rmSCCHN). Pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death-1 inhibitor, is indicated as first-line treatment (tx) for rmSCCHN in some pts; however, tumour response rates are low.1,2 CAF-rich tumours suppress response to immunotherapy by excluding cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).3NOX1/4 are key drivers of fibrogenesis. Pre-clinical models suggest that, as NOX4 inhibition by setanaxib may prevent and reverse differentiation of CAFs, combination tx of setanaxib with pembrolizumab may improve clinical outcomes in CAF-rich tumours.3 Trial design: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial (NCT05323656), 60 pts with rmSCCHN (Table) will be randomised 1:1 (stratified by tumour human papillomavirus status) to oral setanaxib 800 mg twice daily or placebo, plus intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks, for <=24 months. The primary objective will be to evaluate and compare best percentage change from baseline in tumour diameter (using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] 1.1) between tx arms. Key secondary objectives will include comparisons of progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 and change from baseline in tumour CAF and CD8+ TIL levels between tx arms. The study is currently recruiting in France, Germany, Poland, Spain, the UK and the USA. 1NICE https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta661/ accessed 13/04/22; 2Bauml J Clin Oncol 2017;35:1542-9; 3Ford K Cancer Res 2020;80:1846-60.

AB  - Introduction/Background In 2022, over 8.2 million refugees were recorded across Europe after the Russian invasion in Ukraine. As every human crisis, the war is associated with changes in access to medical care. Due to the cervical cancer pathogenesis, results of compromised prevention may become visible after years since the beginning of war. The aim of the study was to evaluate experience of European centres in cervical cancer prevention among Ukrainian refugees. Methodology This was a cross-sectional questionnaire based study. Questionnaires were distributed among clinicians from the European Network of Young Gynae Oncologists (ENYGO) network until August 2022. Our survey included questions about managing patients who voluntary reported exclusively for the purpose of cervical cancer screening or treatment of preinvasive cervical lesions. Results Our analysis included data obtained from 38 respondents practicing in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, and the UK. More than one third of these centres were accredited by the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO). Seven (17%) centres reported participation in Ukrainian refugees gynaecological cancer prevention measures. Seven (17%) respondent sites collected Pap smear or human papillomavirus (HPV) test. Three (7%) centres reported demand for HPV vaccination from the Ukrainian refugees. Seven (17%) clinical centres managed Ukrainian refugees with precancerous cervical lesions. More than half of these patients (54%) required primary invasive treatment. 15% were admitted for continuation of treatment. 7% required follow-up after treatment. 23% underwent further diagnostic regimen without indication for invasive treatment. Conclusion Prevention and treatment of cervical lesions in terms of war in Ukraine pose significant challenge both for European healthcare providers and Ukrainian refugees. The results obtained in present study show that even in specialized oncologic centres, which are mostly dedicated to treat invasive disease, Ukrainian refugees report and require both preventive and curative services of cervical lesions.

AB  - Introduction/Background Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 is considered a high-grade squamous intraepi-thelial lesion requiring surgical treatment. Excisional cervical procedures, though, have been linked to an increased risk of preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies. Therefore, and given the fact that the vast majority of CIN2 cases will regress, there is a tendency to avoid surgical treatment for women who wish fertility preservation. The aim of the CIN2DIN study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of P16/Ki-67 immunocytochemistry (ICC) for the timely detection of CIN3 +, among women with untreated CIN2, compared to cytology. Methodology According to the study design, women with biopsy confirmed CIN2, after written informed consent, will be subjected to cervicovaginal sampling for p16/Ki-67 ICC (CINtec PLUS, Roche laboratories AG, Mannheim, Germany), cytology and high-risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing (cobas HPV Test, Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) (t=0). After six months (t=1), participants will be subjected to colposcopy, and, cervicovaginal sampling for cytology and p16/Ki-67 ICC. After 12 months (t=2) participants will be subjected to colposcopy, and, to cervicovaginal sampling for hrHPV testing, cytology and p16/Ki-67 ICC. Participants will be also examined after 18 and 24 months (t=3, t=4, respectively). Examinations at t=3 and t=4 will be similar to t=1, and t=2 respectively. All women after visit t=4 exit the study and are referred to treatment according to the local guidelines. Results To date 5 women with biopsy proven CIN2 have been recruited. Those women have been subjected to pap test, hrHPV testing, and p16/Ki-67 ICC. Conclusion The CIN2DIN study is original and innovative. So far, no studies have been conducted on the value of P16/Ki-67 ICC for CIN2 surveillance. If the study identifies high correlation of P16/Ki-67 ICC to colposcopy, larger studies could be designed to investigate longer-term reassurance for the surveillance of women with untreated CIN2 without colposcopy.

AB  - Background: Cervical cytology remains widely used as the initial tool in cervical cancer screening worldwide. WHO guidelines recommend replacing cytology with primary HPV testing to reach cervical cancer elimination goals. We assessed the performance of cytology and high-risk HPV testing to detect cervical precancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) among women aged 30-64 years participating in the ESTAMPA study. Method(s): Women were screened with cytology and HPV across ESTAMPA study centres in Latin America. Screen-positives were referred to colposcopy with biopsy collection and treatment as needed. Those with no evident precancer were recalled at 18-months for a second HPV test to complete disease ascertainment. Performance indicators for cytology and HPV to detect CIN3+ were estimated. Finding(s): 30,606 participants with available cytology and HPV results were included in the analysis. A total of 440 histologically confirmed CIN3s and 30 cancers were diagnosed. Cytology sensitivity for CIN3+ was 48.5% (95% CI: 44.0-53.0), whereas HPV testing had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI: 96.3-96.7). Specificity was 96.5% (95% CI: 96.3-96.7) using cytology and 88.7% (95% CI: 88.3-89.0) with HPV. Performance estimates varied substantially by study centre for cytology (ranging from 32.1% to 87.5% for sensitivity and from 89.2% to 99.5% for specificity) while for HPV results were more consistent across sites (96.7%-100% and 83.6-90.8%, respectively). Interpretation(s): The limited and highly variable sensitivity of cytology strongly supports transition to the more robust and reproducible HPV-based cervical screening to ensure progress towards global cervical cancer elimination targets in Latin America. Funding(s): IARC/WHO, UNDP, HRP/WHO, NCI and local funders.Copyright © 2023

AB  - Introduction & Objectives: Penile cancer is a rare tumor entity in the European region, therefore, only few data on prognostic factors from mostly smaller cohorts are available. The prognostic value of HPV infection, which is responsible for 40-50% of penile carcinomas, remains unclear. In addition, only few studies investigated the role of p16INK4a, a negative prognostic factor in other tumor entities, in penile cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): 236 patients from Germany, Russia and Portugal were included. Tumor samples were examined with regard to histological subtype, HPV and p16 status. Survival analyses were performed using log-rank test and the Cox regression model for univariable and multivariable analysis. Result(s): HPV-induced tumourigenesis did not show significant differences for metastasis-free, tumour-specific or overall survival compared to HPV negative tumours. Metastasis-free survival was significantly better in p16 positive tumours (p = 0.026), which was also confirmed in the subgroup analysis of HPV-negative tumours (p = 0.037), while no differences were shown for tumour-specific and overall survival. Furthermore, the analysis of the p16 status in the usual type did not show significant difference, but a clear trend in metastasis-free survival towards a worse outcome in p16 negative tumours (p = 0.070). In multivariable Cox regression, p16 status was highly significantly associated with metastasis-free survival (Hazard ratio 0.3; p = 0.004), while tumours with a pT1b (p = 0.007) or N3 stage (p = <0.001) showed significantly worse outcome. In the multivariable analysis of HPV-negative tumours, p16INK4a is also a significant parameter for metastasisfree survival (Hazard ratio 0.2; p = 0.007). Conclusion(s): While HPV status alone seems to be of minor prognostic relevance, p16 status plays an important role in prognosis estimation. In addition to lymphovascular or lymphonodal infiltration, p16 inactivation is associated with poorer metastasis-free survival. As p16INK4a is a surrogate marker for HPV infection and has therefore a distinct biological function, it should be evaluated separately in HPV-negative tumours to define its prognostic value and thus further for therapy decision making.Copyright © 2023 European Association of Urology.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the eighth most frequent cancer in Saudi Arabia, and most cases are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. HPV-induced carcinogenesis may be associated with the intra-type variant, genetic mutation, or the continuous expression of viral oncogenes E6 and E7. Infection efficiency and virus antigenicity may be affected by changes in the L1 gene. Thus, this retrospective cohort study analyzed E6, E7, and L1 gene mutations in cervical specimens collected from Saudi women positive for HPV16 or HPV18 infection. HPV16 and HPV18 lineages in these specimens were predominantly from Europe. The L83V mutation in the E6 gene of HPV16 showed sufficient oncogenic potential for progression to cervical cancer. By contrast, the L28F mutation in the E7 gene of HPV16 was associated with a low risk of cervical cancer. Other specific HPV16 and HPV18 mutations were associated with an increased risk of cancer, cancer progression, viral load, and age. Four novel mutations, K53T, K53N, R365P, and K443N, were identified in the L1 gene of HPV16. These findings for HPV16 and HPV18 lineages and mutations in the E6, E7, and L1 genes among women in Saudi Arabia may inform the design and development of effective molecular diagnostic tests and vaccination strategies for the Saudi population.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Detecting hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes could provide an alternative to liquid-based cytology (LBC) triage within HPV primary cervical screening. The impact of using the QIAsure FAM19A4/mir124-2 DNA Methylation Test (QIAGEN, N.V, Hilden, Germany) on CIN3+ diagnoses, retention, unnecessary colposcopies, and programme costs is unknown. A decision-tree model was developed to compare LBC with the QIAsure Methylation testing to guide colposcopy referral. Incorporating clinician- and self-sampling pathways the model was informed by the Dutch cervical cancer screening programme, published studies, and manufacturer data. Clinical and cost outcomes were assessed using two scenarios for DNA methylation testing and LBC relative performance. Sensitivity analyses (deterministic and probabilistic) were performed to assess model and parameter uncertainty. A range of self-sampling uptake was assessed in scenario analyses. For the screening cohort (n = 807,269) where 22.1% self-sampled, the number of unnecessary colposcopies and CIN3+ diagnoses varied according to the relative performance of methylation testing and LBC. Irrespective of relative performance, the cost per complete screen was lower and fewer people were lost to follow-up when using DNA methylation testing. The results indicate that, within an HPV primary screening programme that incorporates self-sampling, using the QIAsure Methylation Test for triage reduces the cost per screen compared to LBC.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Endocervical glandular atypia is relatively rarely diagnosed by Pap smears. A significant proportion of follow-up histological samples show no premalignant or malignant lesions. The observed cytomorphological findings in premalignant glandular lesions overlap with histologically proven reactive lesions. Method(s): A total of 45 conventional Pap smears diagnosed as atypical endocervical cells, not otherwise specified (AEC, NOS) with human papillomavirus (HPV) status available were blindly evaluated in a search for 38 cytomorphological features representing background, architectural, cellular, and nuclear features. Of the cases, 30 represented histologically proven benign changes, and 15 represented histologically proven adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or endocervical adenocarcinoma (EAC) cases. The benign biopsies were re-evaluated, and the associations of the cytomorphological features or combinations of them with specific histological features and entities were statistically examined. Result(s): The most frequent histological findings in the benign group were squamous metaplasia, inflammation, tubal metaplasia, and microglandular hyperplasia. The statistical analysis revealed cytological features associated with squamous metaplastic changes, inflammation, and microglandular hyperplasia. Unfortunately, no cytomorphological feature was sufficiently specific to confidently leave the lesion without follow-up and histological correlation. Degeneration and nuclear crowding were the most salient features that distinguished the instances of glandular atypia with benign follow-up histology from those with histologically proven AIS or EAC (26.7 vs. 60.0%, p = 0.030, and 50.0 vs. 86.7%, p = 0.017). Conclusion(s): Additional methods besides cytomorphology are required to reliably distinguish smears with AEC, NOS harbouring only benign histological changes from those exhibiting endocervical glandular malignancy.© 2023 S.

AB  - Background: Effective immune surveillance requires a functioning immune system and natural killer (NK) and T cells for adequate innate and antigen-specific immune responses critically depending on human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and haplotypes representing advantageous combinations of HLA antigens. Recently, we reported a link between altered frequencies of HLA alleles and haplotypes and developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Whereas the majority of HNSCCs seem to be related to classical risk factors alcohol and tobacco, a subset of HNSCC and especially oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) were etiologically linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) recently. Here, we demonstrate in HPV-driven (p16-positive high risk-HPV DNA-positive) HNSCC a deviating distribution of HLA antigens and haplotypes and their relevance to outcome. Method(s): Leukocyte DNA of n = 94 HPV-driven HNSCC patients (n = 57 OPSCC, n = 37 outside oropharynx) underwent HLA SSO typing, allowing allele, antigen (allele group), and haplo-typing. Besides comparing these frequencies with those of German blood donors, we analyzed their impact on outcome using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazard regression. Result(s): Antigen and haplotype frequencies demonstrate enrichment of rare antigens and haplotypes. The HLA score for unselected HNSCC patients was not predictive for outcome here. However, together with alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, T category, and extranodal extension of locoregional metastases and treatment applied, eight HLA traits allow for predicting progression-free and tumor-specific survival. Conclusion(s): Patients can be categorized into low, intermediate-low, intermediate-high, and high risk groups. Using a new PFS risk score for HPV-driven HNSCC may allow to improve prognostication.Copyright © 2023 Wichmann, Vetter, Lehmann, Landgraf, Doxiadis, Grosmann, Vorobeva, Dietz, Zebralla, Wiegand and Wald.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: After the transition toward the HPV-based screening protocol, which has led to an increase in sensitivity, and in order to bring the specificity back to acceptable values, cytology underwent a change of approach, becoming a triage test. For these reasons, in the Tuscany region (after the recommendations of the GISCi document), it was decided to reduce, as much as possible, the use of ASC-US category in cytology triage, classifying these morphological cases as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancies (NILM) or LSIL, basing on the grade of nuclear atypia. So, in Italy, in a cytology triage context (HPV primary screening), a modified Bethesda system (TBS) is currently used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the review activity of 384 cytology triage cases and of the cervical cancer screening indicators (sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ lesions) using the TBS 2014 or the modified TBS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 384 HPV positive cases at one-year recall (192 with a cytology result of NILM both at baseline and at one-year recall; 192 with a cytology result of NILM at baseline but abnormal at one-year recall), all with a histologically confirmed result (128 CIN2+, 256 </= CIN1), were selected, and their baseline Pap tests were reviewed in blind mode by 5 expert cytologists. RESULTS: The cytological results of NILM were confirmed for 92.5% and 83.8% of cases using TBS 2014 or modified TBS, respectively. 20/128 CIN2+ cases could have been reported at the baseline cytology triage, causing an anticipatory effect and an improvement in sensitivity of the screening protocol at baseline (+15.6%). Using TBS 2014, the number of false positives more than tripled with respect to the modified TBS 2014, with a significant increase in unnecessary colposcopies (+11.4%). CONCLUSION: This work demonstrated that a greater expertise of cytologists, acquired during the following 3 years of experience with cytological triage, and a strong IQC system could lead to the identification of a significant number of lesions reported to baseline rather than at one-year recall (diagnostic anticipation).

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the leading causes of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), while the correlation between HPV and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains controversial. The inflammatory infiltrate involved in these epithelial neoplasms differs based on their association with HPV. HPV- tumors show higher tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) infiltration. It is believed that TANs can play a dual role in cancer by exerting either anti-tumorigenic or pro-tumorigenic effects. However, the impact of HPV status on neutrophil polarization remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of OSCC cells, both HPV- and HPV16+, on the functional phenotype of neutrophils. Peripheral blood neutrophils were stimulated with supernatants from OSCC cell lines and non-tumorigenic HaCaT keratinocytes transduced with HPV16 E6/E7 oncogenes. Subsequently, cytokine production, cell viability, metabolism, expression of degranulation markers, and PD-L1 expression were evaluated. Our findings demonstrate that in contrast to UPCI:SCC154 (HPV+ OSCC) cells, the SCC-9 (HPV- OSCC) cell line induced a highly activated functional state in neutrophils, which is potentially associated with a pro-tumorigenic effect. The HaCaT 16-E7 supernatant only stimulated the activation of some neutrophil functions. Understanding the complex interplay between neutrophils and their microenvironment has the potential to identify TANs as viable therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cancer. Female sex workers (FSWs) are known to be at risk for HPV, but little is known about male sex workers (MSWs). Methods We examined HPV prevalence and associated risk factors in both populations. During 2022, HPV testing using vaginal or penile samples, HIV testing, and interviews were performed among 100 MSWs and 100 FSWs in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Results The prevalence of all HPV types was 63.5% (66% in MSW, 61% in FSW), HPV-16 prevalence was 14%, HPV-52 was 13%, and HPV-18 was 4%. There was no difference between MSW and FSW for these subtypes. The prevalence of HPV-16 or HPV-18 was 17%, and for HPV-16, HPV-18, or HPV-52, it was 26%. HIV-positive participants had a higher prevalence of all HPV types (94% vs. 60%, P = 0.004), HPV-16 or HPV-18 (39% vs. 15%, P = 0.018), and HPV-16, HPV-18, or HPV-52 (50% vs. 23%, P = 0.017). Conclusions We demonstrated an equally high HPV prevalence across the sexes. Further studies are needed to determine if this indicates an equal risk for cancer. Increased HPV awareness, screening, and vaccination should be considered, regardless of gender.Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are very widespread, so that most women and men become infected during their lifetime. In Germany approximately 7850 people are diagnosed with cancer caused by HPV infections every year. In the primary prevention HPV vaccine type-associated precancerous lesions and genital warts can be prevented by early HPV vaccination, such as cervical cancer in about 90% of cases. Interesting further developments such as the reduction to a single HPV vaccination injection or the effect of a postintervention vaccination after conization have not yet been conclusively clarified. After more than 2 years of HPV and cytology co-testing in the new screening in women aged 35 years and over, the initial analyses by German laboratories indicate positive effects with improved sensitivity and also specificity. A challenge is the increased persistence rate of HPV positive/Pap negative findings in the further course with the necessity to longitudinally evaluate innovative clarification methods, such as dual stain and methylation tests with respect to implementation in the triage routine.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are a common type of cancer, ranking as the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide and having a high morbidity and mortality rate. Among oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cancers, tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is the most prevalent and has a particularly aggressive clinical course with poor disease outcomes. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HNSCC is complex and heterogeneous, playing a crucial role in effective cancer therapy. Understanding the interaction between cancer inflammation, immunity, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes is essential for developing effective cancer treatments. This study aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptomes of the TME in TSCC, both associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) and not associated with HPV. The gene expression profiles of 168 genes linked to various cellular mediators and factors involved in inflammation, immunity crosstalk, transcription, signal transduction, oncogenesis, tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were analyzed. We identified 40 differentially expressed genes related to the communication between tumor cells and the cellular mediators of inflammation and immunity crosstalk. In HPV-positive TSCC patients, 33 genes were over-expressed with a fold change greater than 1.5, and 26 of these genes were unique to this group. In contrast, HPV-negative TSCC patients had 11 up-regulated genes. The results further showed that 48 gene transcripts related to oncogenesis, tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were up-regulated in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative TSCC patients. Among the HPV-positive TSCC patients, 37 genes were over-expressed, while the HPV-negative TSCC patients had 11 up-regulated genes. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HPV-associated and HPV-non-associated TSCC exhibited distinct characteristics, including the dysregulation of various genes involved in cellular mediators, inflammation, immunity crosstalk, transcription factors, immune signaling pathways, signal transduction, oncogenesis, tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Additionally, we detected six Hr-HPV genotypes in 81% of the TSCC patients, with HPV-16 and HPV-35 being the most common types, followed by HPV-45 and HPV-18. HPV-39 and 31 were also identified. The presence of Hr-HPV genotypes in TSCC patients varied from single to multiple infections. In conclusion, we observed distinct heterogeneity in the transcriptome of the microenvironment in HPV-associated and non-associated TSCC. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to investigate the functional implications of the identified over-expressed genes. Also, deeper molecular pathways and immunological studies on the TME are required to determine the potential of targeting genes for cancer therapy.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND-AIM Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes differ by geographic location. With the advent of HPV vaccination and HPVbased cervical screening tests in Ethiopia, nationwide data set on the genotype distribution of HPV among women has paramount importance in the fight against cervical cancer. However, there is limited data in this regard in the northwest part of the country. METHODS A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (FHCSH), Bahir Dar - Ethiopia. Women aged >30 years who visited the hospital gynecology unit from 01 March 2019 to 30 October 2021 were included. Following general and pelvic examinations, a senior gynecologist collected cervical swabs for HR-HPV detection using the Abbott Alinity m system (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA), and extended genotyping was carried out with the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra II assay (INNO-LiPA; Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) as per the manufacturer protocols at the Institute of Virology, Leipzig University Hospital, Germany. RESULTS We included 355 women with a mean age of 46.4+11.4 years. The proportion of HR-HPV was 53.0% (n=188; 95%CI: 47.8-58.1%). From these samples, 13 different HR-HPV types with a total of 258 sequences were identified. The detection of HR-HPV increased significantly with an increase in the age of the participants. The predominant identified HR-HPV was HPV16, 50.4% (130/258: 95%CI: 29.4-39.2%) followed by HPV31 (9.7%), HPV33 (8.5%), HPV39 and HPV68 each (5.8%) and HPV18 (4.7%). Of the total HR-HPV-positive women, 23.9% (45/188) were infected with two and more (up to five) multiple HR-HPV types. All HPV16, HPV18, HPV35, and HPV45 genotypes (as a single or in coinfections) were found to be associated with either high-grade lesions or cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS HR-HPV infection was reportedly higher among women in the present study area. Based on our findings, we strongly recommend the nonavalent HPV vaccine for immunization and any HPV-based screening method to take into consideration the predominant genotypes circulating in the country. The role of multiple HPV infections in high-grade cervical lesions entails further study in Ethiopia.

AB  - Drug resistance is a common cause of therapy failure in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). One approach to tackling it is by targeting fundamental cellular processes, such as translation. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (EIF2alpha) is a key player in canonical translation initiation and integrates diverse stress signals; when phosphorylated, it curbs global protein synthesis. This study evaluates EIF2alpha expression and phosphorylation in HNSCC. A small-molecule inhibitor of EIF2alpha dephosphorylation, salubrinal, was tested in vitro, followed by viability assays, flow cytometry, and immunoblot analyses. Patient-derived 3D tumor spheres (PD3DS) were cultured with salubrinal and their viability assessed. Lastly, salubrinal was evaluated with standard-of-care chemotherapeutics. Our analysis of RNA and proteomics data shows elevated EIF2alpha expression in HNSCC. Immunohistochemical staining reveals increasing EIF2alpha abundance from premalignant lesions to invasive and metastatic carcinoma. In immunoblots from intraoperative samples, EIF2alpha expression and steady-state phosphorylation are higher in HNSCC than in neighboring normal tissue. Inhibition of EIF2alpha dephosphorylation decreases HNSCC cell viability and clonogenic survival and impairs the G1/S transition. Salubrinal also decreases the viability of PD3DS and acts synergistically with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and proteasome inhibitors. Our results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EIF2alpha dephosphorylation is a potential therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The statutory cancer screening program (GKFP) covers regulations for early detection and screening of cancer for men and women in Germany. Costs for these assessments are covered by the health insurance. The G-BA is in charge of the organized screening, in which women between 20 and 34 years of age are entitled to a yearly screening assessment based on cytology smears. Women of 35 years and older are offered a combination of HPV testing and cytology every 3 years. Data showed a reduced incidence of invasive carcinoma of the cervix as well as of precancerous lesions and overall mortality. Participation in screening assessments for cervical cancer is recommended independently of HPV vaccination status for all women in the according age range. Prophylactic vaccination against HPV high risk types are recommended for all children and adolescents independently of the gender between 9-14 years of age, but before the first sexual intercourse. However, the license according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) covers all children irrespective of the gender starting at 9 years of age without defining an upper age limit. At the moment, two HPV vaccines are available. For both vaccines, a 2-dose-vaccination regimen is recommended. HPV vaccination can also be valuable for adolescents and adults older than 17 years and to reduce reinfection rates after HPV infection. In this case, HPV vaccination is solely a prophylactic measure and has no therapeutic effect.Copyright © 2023 Mediengruppe Oberfranken - Fachverlage GmbH & Co. KG. All rights reserved.

AB  - C1orf74, also known as URCL4, has been reported to have higher expression and be associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients, and its role in regulation of the EGFR/AKT/mTORC1 pathway has been recently elucidated. In the current study, we used publicly available data and experimental validation of C1orf74 gene expression and its association with prognosis in cervical cancer patients. qRT-PCR was performed using RNA from cervical cancer cell lines and twenty-five cervical cancer patients. Data from TNMplot revealed that mRNA expression of the C1orf74 gene in primary tumor tissues, as well as metastatic tissues from cervical cancer patients, was significantly higher compared to normal cervical tissues. HPV-positive tumors had higher expression of this gene compared to HPV-negative tumors. qPCR analysis also demonstrated higher expression of C1orf74 in HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines and most cervical cancer patients. The promoter methylation levels of the C1orf74 gene in cervical cancer tissues were lower compared to normal cervical tissues (p < 0.05). Collectively, our study indicates that higher expression of the C1orf74 gene caused by hypomethylation of its promoter is associated with poor overall survival in cervical cancer patients. Thus, C1orf74 is a novel prognostic marker in cervical cancer.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasingly prevalent. Despite the overall more favorable outcome, the observed heterogeneous treatment response within this patient group highlights the need for additional means to prognosticate and guide clinical decision-making. Promising prediction models using radiomics from primary OPSCC have been derived. However, no model/s using metastatic lymphadenopathy exist to allow prognostication in those instances when the primary tumor is not seen. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether radiomics using metastatic lymphadenopathy allows for the development of a useful risk assessment model comparable to the primary tumor and whether additional knowledge of the HPV status further improves its prognostic efficacy. Material(s) and Method(s): 80 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III-IV OPSCC between February 2009 and October 2015, known human papillomavirus status, and pre-treatment CT images were retrospectively identified. Manual segmentation of primary tumor and metastatic lymphadenopathy was performed and the extracted texture features were used to develop multivariate assessment models to prognosticate treatment response. Result(s): Texture analysis of either the primary or metastatic lymphadenopathy from pre-treatment enhanced CT images can be used to develop models for the stratification of treatment outcomes in OPSCC patients. AUCs range from.78 to.85 for the various OPSCC groups tested, indicating high predictive capability of the models. Conclusion(s): This preliminary study can form the basis multi-centre trial that may help optimize treatment and improve quality of life in patients with OPSCC in the era of personalized medicine.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and elucidate the effects and mechanism of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) on the local immune response of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2). Material(s) and Method(s): Immunofluorescence staining was used to compare immune cells infiltration before and after ALA-PDT in 23 patients with CIN2. The infiltration of immune cells into the cervical tissues of patients with different outcomes was also compared at the 6-month follow-up period. Immune cell counts in samples collected before and after treatment were compared. Result(s): We found an increased number of CD8+ T cell infiltration, an increased proportion of CD8+ T cells expressing Granzyme B (GrB), Chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), and CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, and a decreased proportion of CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 in patients with CIN2 compared to that before ALA-PDT. Moreover, at the 6-month follow-up, there was higher infiltration of CD8+ T and CD8+ TRM cells, higher expression of GrB and CXCR3, and lower expression of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells in the HPV clearance and CIN2 disappearance groups than in the HPV-positive and CIN2 regression groups. However, no significant difference was observed in the number of CD8+ TSCM following ALA-PDT. Conclusion(s): ALA-PDT could activate CD8+ T cell responses by modulating the expression of CXCR3 and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ TRM cells. And the infiltration of CD8+ T cells is correlated with the prognosis of CIN2.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Niu, Hong, Gu, Huang and Qiu.

AB  - Background: Primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix and endometrium are rare gynecological malignancies with limited treatment options. This study aimed to improve the understanding of the carcinogenesis process and identify potential therapeutic targets for these two tumor types by constructing the mutational landscape at the whole exome level. Method(s): Primary tumor tissues and their matched blood samples were obtained from 10 patients with small cell cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECC) and five patients with small cell endometrial neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECE). Whole exome sequencing was performed to construct the somatic mutation profiles. Mutational signature and recurrent mutated gene analysis were used to identify tumor subtypes and common carcinogenesis processes. Result(s): Based on the burden of different mutational signatures, the NECCs in this work can be divided into two subtypes, including the mismatch repair deficiency like (dMMR-like) type (4/10) and the high spontaneous deamination type (6/10). Components of the PI3K/AKT signaling and RAS signaling were exclusively mutated in these two subtypes, respectively. The integration of human papillomavirus made a limited contribution to tumorigenesis in NECC (20%). The dysfunction of the mismatch repair system and microsatellite instability are the major features of NECE. PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT signaling, and chromatin remodeling activity were the common mutated pathways in NECE. PIK3CA, WNK2, and KMT2B underwent mutations in both the dMMR-like subtype of NECC (50% - 75%) and in NECE (60% - 80%) specimens, while exhibiting infrequent mutational occurrences in publicly available data pertaining to neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung or bladder (< 10%). Conclusion(s): We identified the two subtypes of NECC with distinct mutated pathways and potential therapy targets. The dMMR-like type NECC and NECE may share a similar carcinogenesis process that include dysfunction of PI3K/AKT signaling, cell cycle, antiapoptotic processes, and chromatin remodeling activity.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Zhang, Li, Chen, Gu, Shan, Li, Chen, Jin and Pan.

AB  - The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant public health concern due to its association with the development of cervical cancer. Although inflammation caused by Candida spp. has been shown to facilitate oncogenesis, the interactions between HPV and Candida spp. remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genotype distribution of HR-HPV infection HR-HPV-positiveCandida albicans in HR-HPV-positive individuals in Diyarbakir province in Turkey. Cervical samples were taken from 350 participants aged 20-69 years who applied to Diyarbakir Gazi Yasargil Training and Research Hospital, Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic. For detection of HPV presence and HR-HPV genotyping, PCR/direct cycle sequencing was used. E6/E7 mRNA expression of HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, and -45 was determined by type-specific real-time NASBA assay (NucliSENS EasyQ()HPV v1.1). The presence of Candida albicans in cervical specimens of HR-HPV-positive women was investigated by RAPD-PCR and culture methods. Results. Of the 350 women who participated in the study, 24% were HPV positive and 10.5% were found to be HR-HPV positive. HR-HPV positivity was most frequently detected in the age range of 40-49 years. Among HR-HPV-positive women, C. albicans was found in 59.4%. Conclusion. The most frequent HR-HPV genotype was HPV16, followed by HPV31. Of women who tested positive for HR-HPV, C. albicans was discovered in 59.4%. C. albicans infection may occur when the immune system is weakened or the balance of the vaginal flora is disturbed, increasing tissue damage in the vaginal area and the risk of carcinogenesis of HR-HPV. Therefore, knowing the presence of Candida infection in HR-HPV-positive women is essential to plan the treatment and prevent the risk of secondary disease.Copyright © 2023 Efdal Oktay Gultekin and Behzat Can.

AB  - Cervical cancer, a major health concern among women worldwide, is closely linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study explores the evolving landscape of HPV molecular epidemiology in Taiwan over a decade (2010-2020), where prophylactic HPV vaccination has been implemented since 2007. Analyzing data from 40,561 vaginal swab samples, with 42.0% testing positive for HPV, we reveal shifting trends in HPV genotype distribution and infection patterns. The 12 high-risk genotypes, in order of decreasing percentage, were HPV 52, 58, 16, 18, 51, 56, 39, 59, 33, 31, 45, and 35. The predominant genotypes were HPV 52, 58, and 16, accounting for over 70% of cases annually. The proportions of high-risk and non-high-risk HPV infections varied across age groups. High-risk infections predominated in sexually active individuals aged 30-50 and were mixed-type infections. The composition of high-risk HPV genotypes was generally stable over time; however, HPV31, 33, 39, and 51 significantly decreased over the decade. Of the strains, HPV31 and 33 are shielded by the nonavalent HPV vaccine. However, no reduction was noted for the other seven genotypes. This study offers valuable insights into the post-vaccine HPV epidemiology. Future investigations should delve into HPV vaccines' effects and their implications for cervical cancer prevention strategies. These findings underscore the need for continued surveillance and research to guide effective public health interventions targeting HPV-associated diseases.

AB  - Background & objectives: Vulvar adenocarcinoma of intestinal type (VAIt) is uncommon. In an attempt to clarify the aetiology, clinicopathologic spectrum of this neoplasm and to inspire additional research into their biology, two more cases of VAIt are reported, including immunohistochemical and molecular analysis. Method(s): Two VAIt cases were identified and stained for immunohistochemical markers. After DNA extraction using DNA isolation, I kit on a Magnapure LC instrument (Roche Molecular, Mannheim, Germany), amplification was performed in 15 separate real-time Polymerase chain reactions, one for each of the 14 Human Papillomavirus types and one for beta-globin. Targeted Next-generation DNA sequencing was used to assess somatic mutations. Result(s): Two patients of 63 years old each presented with an exophytic vulvar mass. At microscopic examination, a primary adenocarcinoma resembling a colorectal cancer, was identified in both cases. The infiltrative area displayed a glandular architecture, with glands of variable size and shape, lined by columnar to cuboidal cells with large nuclei and coarse chromatin; goblet cells were present. Based on microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis both tumours were diagnosed as HPV-independent VAIt FIGO stage 1. Both cases harboured pathogenic somatic mutation of TP53 (Case 1: P.Arg248Gln; Case 2: P.Gly266Glu). In addition, case 1 displayed pathogenic somatic mutation of KRAS (p.Gly12Asp) and case 2 showed DPYD variant (p.Glu412=/HapB3[AP1]). Conclusion(s): VAIt is a rare HPV-independent tumour harbouring TP53, KRAS and DPYD mutations similar to colorectal adenocarcinomas which might indicate an increased risk for lymph node and distant metastases but also that they might be resistant to chemotherapy and might respond to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody therapy.

AB  - Canine pigmented viral plaques (PVPs) are proliferative epidermal lesions caused by canine papillomaviruses (CPVs). Although the lesions are benign, neoplastic transformation has been reported. Cases reported in the literature are few and mainly focused on genome sequencing. The aim of this study was to collect data on the epidemiology, clinicopathological features, and genotyping of PVPs. Fifty-five canine PVPs were retrospectively retrieved and histologically evaluated. Follow-up was available for 33 cases. The median age was 6.5 years and pugs were the most represented breed (25%). There were 4 clinical presentations: a single lesion (24%), multiple lesions (75%) in one (41%) or different sites (34%), and generalized lesions all over the body (24%). The abdomen and axillae were the most common sites. In single lesions, no recurrence was observed after conventional surgery, whereas different medical treatments reported for multiple lesions were not successful. Spontaneous regression was reported in 3 cases. Neoplasia in contiguity with PVPs was seen in 5 of 55 lesions (9%), and 1 dog was euthanized due to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The most useful histopathological features for diagnosis were scalloped profile, epidermal spikes, hypergranulosis, and hyperpigmentation. L1 immunolabeling was present in 14 of 16 cases (87%). Sequencing revealed that 10 of 16 cases were associated with CPV-9 (71%), 2 cases were associated with CPV-4 (14%), and 2 cases were associated with CPV-8 (14%). In conclusion, this represents a large cohort study on canine PVPs reporting data on clinicopathological features, therapy, outcome, and the type of CPV involved for the first time in Italy.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Importance: Given the increased incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) in recent decades, identifying minimally invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis is essential to decreasing disease- and treatment-related morbidity. Two such biomarkers, circulating tumor HPV DNA (ctHPVDNA) and HPV16 E6 seropositivity, are highly sensitive and specific for HPV-positive OPC. We recently reported detection of tumor tissue modified viral (TTMV) HPV16 DNA - a ctHPVDNA assay designed to detect HPV DNA derived from tumors - in blood collected several years before HPV16-positive OPC diagnosis. E6 seropositivity has been demonstrated several decades before diagnosis and is under consideration as a screening biomarker in highincidence populations. The two biomarkers have not been compared in the prediagnostic setting. Objective(s): Compare pre-diagnostic HPV16 early antigen seropositivity and TTMV-HPV16 DNA detection to understand their temporal relationship with respect to clinical disease manifestation. Method(s): Participants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank hospital-based cohort research study with available blood samples collected >=6 months before diagnosis were selected. Tumor and plasma TTMV-HPV DNA testing was performed by Naveris (Natick MA). Cases were included for plasma testing only if TTMV-HPV DNA from HPV types 16/18/31/33/35 was detected in tumor tissue. Plasma was tested for antibodies to HPV16 antigens E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7 using multiplex serology by the German Cancer Research Center. Result(s): The study population comprised of 9 cases of HPV16- positive HNCs, 7 with OPCs and 2 with lateral tongue tumors, and 45 matched controls. Most cases were male (8/9) and all were white, with median age 70 (range, 51-93). Plasma was collected median 34 months (range, 19-76 months) before diagnosis. HPV16 E6 seropositivity was observed in 6/9 HNC cases, all of which were OPCs. Two controls were HPV16 E6 seropositive. Upon updated medical record review, one of these E6 seropositive controls had been diagnosed with HPV-positive OPC in the interim between study initiation and data analysis, 18 months after control cohort selection and 63 months after blood collection. When this control subject was included as an HPV-positive OPC case, prediagnostic E6 seropositivity was observed in 7/10 HNC cases and 7/8 OPC cases. TTMV-HPV16 DNA was detected in plasma from 3/10 HNC cases, all 3 of which were OPCs that were seropositive for >=4 HPV16 early antigens, including E6. In contrast, among the 7 cases with undetectable TTMV-HPV16 DNA, only 1 was seropositive for >=4 antigens. Conclusion(s): The higher prediagnostic prevalence of HPV16 E6 seropositivity than TTMV-HPV16 DNA detection suggests that E6 seroconversion occurs before tumor DNA is shed into circulation at detectable levels. Our data suggest that TTMV-HPV16 DNA testing may be a reasonable component of investigating HPV16 E6 seropositive individuals who are at risk for HPV-positive OPC.

AB  - Next to alcohol and tobacco abuse, infection with human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is a major risk factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), leading to 350,000 casualties worldwide each year. Limited therapy options and drug resistance raise the urge for alternative methods such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive procedure used to treat HNSCC and other cancers. We prepared lipid-coated polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin as the photosensitizer (CUR-LCNPs). The prepared CUR-LCNPs were in the nanometer range (153.37 +/- 1.58 nm) and showed an encapsulation efficiency of 92.69 +/- 0.03%. Proper lipid coating was visualized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The CUR-LCNPs were tested in three HPVpos and three HPVneg HNSCC lines regarding their uptake capabilities and in vitro cell killing capacity, revealing a variable but highly significant tumor cell inhibiting effect in all tested HNSCC cell lines. No significant differences were detected between the HPVpos and HPVneg HNSCC groups (mean IC50: (9.34 +/- 4.73 micromol/L vs. 6.88 +/- 1.03 micromol/L), suggesting CUR-LCNPs/PDT to be a promising therapeutic option for HNSCC patients independent of their HPV status.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of primary HPV cervical cancer screening, the identification of minor screening abnormalities necessitates triage tests to optimize management and mitigate overtreatment. Currently, reflex cytology and reflex p16/Ki67 dual-stain (DS) are under scrutiny for their applicability in primary HPV-based screening. However, there remains a dearth of comprehensive data for comparing their performance. METHODS: Among 30,066 results from liquid-based cervical cancer screening tests, a cohort of 332 cases was meticulously selected based on available high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) test results, limited genotyping for HPV 16 and 18, liquid-based cytology, DS, and histology outcomes from standardized colposcopy with biopsy. For cases positive for 12 other high-risk HPV genotypes, three retrospective triage approaches were analyzed. We computed the positive predictive value (PPV) for the detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+). RESULTS: Both triage models employing DS (reflex cytology followed by DS and reflex DS alone in all cases) exhibited significantly higher PPV for HSIL+ compared to the strategy with reflex cytology alone (35.9%/33.3% vs. 18.8%; p < 0.0001). Additionally, these DS-based models showed higher negative predictive values (NPV) (100%/96.2% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.0024/0.0079). In the DS-inclusive models, fewer colposcopies were necessitated (103/102 vs. 154), and fewer cases of HSIL+ were overlooked (0/3 vs. 8). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that p16/Ki67 dual-stain, either as a standalone or combined triage test, holds promise for the effective detection of HSIL+ in patients with minor screening abnormalities in primary HPV-based cervical cancer screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) exhibits greater vulnerability to mutations and/or copy numbe variations than nuclear counterpart (nDNA) in both normal and cancer cells due to oxidative stress generated by inflam mation, viral infections, physical, mechanical, and chemical load. The study was designed to evaluate the mtDNA conten in oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Various parameters wer analyzed including its variation with human papillomavirus (HPV) during oral carcinogenesis. METHOD(S): The present cross-sectional study comprised of two hundred patients (100 OPMDs and 100 OSCCs) an 100 healthy controls. PCR amplifications were done for mtDNA content and HPV in OPMDs and OSCC using real-tim and conventional PCR respectively. RESULT(S): The relative mtDNA content was assessed quantitatively and it was observed that mtDNA was greater i OSCC (7.60+/-0.94) followed by OPMDs (5.93+/-0.92) and controls (5.37+/-0.95). It showed a positive linear correlatio with habits and increasing histopathological grades. Total HPV-positive study groups showed higher mtDNA conten (7.06+/-1.64) than HPV-negative counterparts (6.21+/-1.29). CONCLUSION(S): An elevated mutant mtDNA may be attributed to increased free radicals and selective cell clona proliferation in test groups. Moreover, sustained HPV infection enhances tumorigenesis through mitochondria mediate apoptosis. Since, mtDNA content is directly linked to oxidative DNA damage, these quantifications might serve as a sur rogate measure for invasiveness in dysplastic lesions and typify their malignant potential.Copyright © 2023 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - Introduction Cervical cancer, primarily driven by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, stands as a substantial global health challenge. The TP53 gene's, Arg72Pro polymorphism has emerged as a noteworthy player in cervical cancer development, particularly among individuals harboring high-risk (HR) HPV types. Additionally, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), exemplified by metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), exert critical roles in cancer biology. This study delves into unravelling the intricate connections linking HPV infection, TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism, and MALAT1 expression in the context of cervical cancer. Materials and methods Within a cohort of cervical cancer patients, we discerned HPV infection statuses, executed genotyping for the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism, and quantified MALAT1 expression through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses meticulously probed relationships intertwining HPV infection, TP53 polymorphism, and MALAT1 expression. Findings Our investigation revealed a striking prevalence of the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism among HPV-positive subjects, accompanied by a robust and statistically significant correlation linking MALAT1 overexpression (p<0.01) and HR-HPV positivity (p<0.03). Importantly, a subset of MALAT1 overexpression cases unveiled a concomitant TP53 Pro72Pro polymorphism. In contrast, HPV-negative invasive cervical carcinoma samples exhibited no discernible shifts in MALAT1 expression. Conclusion The contours of our findings sketch a compelling landscape wherein HR-HPV infection, TP53 polymorphism, and MALAT1 expression intertwine significantly in cervical cancer. The voyage ahead entails delving deeper into molecular underpinnings to decipher MALAT1's nuanced role and its dance with TP53 within HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis. This expedition promises insights that may engender targeted therapeutic interventions and bespoke prognostic markers, tailored to the realm of HR-HPV-related cervical cancer.Copyright: © 2023 Iordanishvili et al.

AB  - Background: Infections with human papillomaviruses (HPV) are sexually transmitted and can cause cancer. In Germany, vaccination against HPV is recommended for girls and boys aged 9-17years. We aimed to investigate HPV DNA prevalence, genotype distribution and vaccine effectiveness (VE) in women aged 20-25years 10years after the introduction of HPV vaccination in Germany (2018-2019), and compared these data to an equally designed study from 2010-2012. Method(s): Seventy six geographical clusters were randomly selected, followed by random selection of 61 women aged 20-25years per cluster. Participants performed cervicovaginal self-sampling and answered questions on demographics, sexual behaviour and HPV vaccination. Samples were tested for 18 high risk and nine low risk HPV genotypes. We performed chi-square tests, Fisher's exact test, unpaired Student's t-test and proportion t-test, and calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs. Result(s): Of 7,858 contacted women a total of 1,226 agreed to participate. Of these, 94 women were positive for HPV types 16 and/or 18. HPV16 prevalence was 7.0% (95% CI 5.6-8.6) and HPV18 prevalence was 0.8% (95% CI 0.4-1.5). HPV6 and HPV11 were rare with only five (0.4%; 0.1-0.9) and one (0%; 95% CI 0.0-0.5) positive tests. Seven hundred fifty-seven women (62%) had received at least one HPV vaccine dose and 348 (28%) were vaccinated as currently recommended. Confounder-adjusted VE was 46.4% (95% CI 4.2-70.1) against HPV16/18 infection and 49.1% (95% CI 8.2-71.8) against infection with at least one HPV genotype covered by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Compared with the 2010-2012 study results, HPV16/18 prevalence dropped from 22.5% (95% CI 19.0-26.3) to 10.3% (95% CI 7.5-13.9; p<0.0001) in unvaccinated participants. Conclusion(s): Vaccine-covered HPV genotypes were rare among 20-25years old women in Germany and decreased compared to the time point shortly after the start of the HPV vaccination program. HPV prevalence of almost all vaccine-covered genotypes was strongly reduced in vaccinated participants. A decrease of HPV16 and HPV18 was even observed in unvaccinated participants, compared to 2010-2012 data, suggesting indirect protection of unvaccinated women. Low VE against HPV16/18 and HPV6/11/16/18 in our study might be attributable to study design in combination with the endpoint selection of (mainly transient) HPV DNA positivity.Copyright © 2023 Loenenbach, Schonfeld, Takla, Wiese-Posselt, Marquis, Thies, Sand, Kaufmann, Wichmann and Harder.

AB  - Background and Aims: Biliary tract cancers are rare, heterogeneous cancers with poor prognoses. Bintrafusp alfa, a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of TGF-betaRII (a TGF-beta "trap") fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody blocking programmed death ligand 1, was evaluated in patients with locally advanced/metastatic chemorefractory biliary tract cancers. Approach and Results: This multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study (NCT03833661) enrolled adults with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer that was intolerant to or had failed first-line systemic platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients received 1200 mg bintrafusp alfa intravenously Q2W. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 assessed by IRC. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, durable response rate, safety, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Between March 2019 and January 2020, 159 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 16.1 (range, 0.0-19.3) months; 17 patients (10.7%; 95% CI: 6.4%-16.6%) achieved an objective response. Median duration of response was 10.0 (range, 1.9-15.7) months; 10 patients (6.3%; 95% CI: 3.1%-11.3%) had a durable response (>=6 mo). Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7-1.8 mo); median overall survival was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.8-9.7 mo). Overall survival rates were 57.9% (6 mo) and 38.8% (12 mo). Grade >=3 adverse events occurred in 26.4% of patients, including one treatment-related death (hepatic failure). Frequent grade >=3 adverse events included anemia (3.8%), pruritus (1.9%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (1.9%). Conclusion(s): Although this study did not meet its prespecified primary endpoint, bintrafusp alfa demonstrated clinical activity as second-line treatment in this hard-to-treat cancer, with durable responses and a manageable safety profile.© Copyright 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The p16/Ki67 technique has been poorly studied in postmenopausal women with ASC-US cytology. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of p16/Ki67 staining, HPV testing and HPV 16 genotyping for the identification of CIN2 + lesions in postmenopausal women with ASC-US cytology. Method(s): A total of 324 postmenopausal women with positive ASC-US were included. The women underwent HPV test, colposcopy, and biopsy. The slides were discolored and then stained with the CINtec Plus Kit for p16/Ki67. The HPV test results were classified as HPV16 +, hrHPV+ (other hrHPV genotypes), or HPV negative. Result(s): The p16/Ki67 sensitivity for CIN2+ was 94.5%, the specificity 86.6%, PPV of 59% and NPV of 95.9%. The HPV test showed a sensitivity of 96.4% for CIN2+, a specificity of 62.8%, a PPV of 35% and a NPV of 98.8%. In postmenopausal women, the prevalence of genotype 16 decreases in favor of the other high-risk genotypes. Conclusion(s): Given the low sensitivity of cytology and the low percentage of HPV16-positive cancers among elderly women, triage via cytology and genotyping is not the best strategy; double staining cytology shows high profiles of sensibility and specificity for CIN2+ in ASCUS postmenopausal women.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to examine potential discriminatory characteristics of dermatoscopy and dynamic optical coherence tomography (D-OCT) on vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (vHSIL) and lichen sclerosus (LS) compared with healthy vulvar skin. Methods A prospective observational clinical trial was performed in 10 healthy volunteers, 5 vHSIL and 10 LS patients. Noninvasive imaging measurements using dermatoscopy and D-OCT were obtained at several time points, including lesional and nonlesional vulvar skin. Morphologic features of vHSIL and LS were compared with healthy controls. Epidermal thickness and blood flow were determined using D-OCT. Patients reported tolerability of each study procedure, including reference vulvar biopsies. The main outcome measures were feasibility and tolerability of imaging modalities, dermatoscopy and OCT characteristics, OCT epidermal thickness and D-OCT dermal blood flow. Results The application of dermatoscopy and D-OCT is feasible and tolerable. In vHSIL, dermatoscopic warty structures were present. In LS, sclerotic areas and arborizing vessels were observed. Structural OCT in the vulvar area aligned with histology for hyperkeratosis and dermal-epidermal junction visualization. Currently, the OCT algorithm is unable to calculate the epidermal thickness of the uneven vulvar area. Dynamic optical coherence tomography showed statistically significant increased blood flow in LS patients (mean +/- SD, 0.053 +/- 0.029) to healthy controls (0.040 +/- 0.012; p =.0024). Conclusions The application of dermatoscopy and D-OCT is feasible and tolerable in vHSIL and LS patients. Using dermatoscopy and D-OCT, the authors describe potential characteristics to aid differentiation of diseased from healthy vulvar skin, which could complement clinical assessments.Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer (CC) is a prevalent malignancy affecting women globally. The primary causative factor of CC is the high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). However, it is noteworthy that not all women infected with HR-HPV develop cancer, indicating the potential involvement of genetic predisposition in the development of CC. This study aims to identify genetic risks and their distribution in groups of women with different epidemiological features of HR-HPV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparison was conducted among four groups of women, comprising 218 HPV-negative women, 120 HPV-positive women, 191 women diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3, and 124 women diagnosed with CC. The analysis focused on four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs55986091 in HLA-DQB1, rs138446575 in TTC34, rs1048943 in CYP1A1, and rs2910164 in miRNA-146a. RESULTS: The rs55986091-A allele exhibited a protective effect within the "CC" group when compared to the "HPV-Negative" group (OR = 0.4, 95% CI= 0.25-0.65) using a log-additive model. Additionally, similar protective effects were observed in the "CIN 2/3" group compared to the "HPV-Negative" group (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.28-0.79). CONCLUSION: The data obtained emphasize the importance of developing PCR-based diagnostic kits for the identification of SNP alleles, particularly for rs55986091, among HR-HPV-positive women within the Russian population.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of atypical glandular cells (AGCs) by analyzing the prevalence and histopathology of AGCs according to cervical cytology. Methods The authors retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the demographic characteristics and histopathological outcomes including pathological diagnosis, pathological site, and epithelial distribution of the AGC cases that were diagnosed by cervical cytology. Results A total of 387 AGC patients with follow-up records were included. Among them, the prevalence of AGC-not otherwise specified (NOS) and AGC-favor neoplastic (FN) was 73.39% (284/387) and 26.62% (103/387), respectively. The high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV)-positive rate was higher in AGC-FN than in AGC-NOS (p =.002). The difference in pathological severity was statistically significant between hr-HPV-positive and negative AGC patients (p =.010). Hr-HPV-positive AGC mainly occurs in cervical diseases, whereas hr-HPV-negative AGC is mainly related to endometrial lesions. Precancerous or malignant lesions were found in 36.43% (141/387) of AGC cases and were more commonly seen in AGC-FN than AGC-NOS (p <.001). The histopathological severity and the incidence of uterine disease were higher among AGC women aged 40 years and older than those younger than 40 years (p <.05). The possibility of the abnormal origin of glandular epithelial was higher than that of squamous epithelial in AGC patients aged 40 years and older (p =.0003). Conclusions The management of AGC women by age triage is reasonable because the incidence of the glandular epithelial lesion and uterine disease increases in AGC patients 40 years or older. Standardized clinical diagnosis and regular follow-up are recommended for all AGC patients.Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: MicroRNA-154-5p (miR-154-5p) plays a role in tumorigenesis in diverse human malignancies. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanism by which miR-154-5p alters the growth and metastasis of cervical cancer. This research aimed to analyze the role of miR-154-5p in the pathology of cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): The level of miR-154-5p in human papillomavirus 16 positive cervical cancer cells was examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics predicted the downstream targets and potential functions of miR-154-5p. Furthermore, lentiviral technology was used to construct SiHa cell lines with stable up- and down-expression levels of miR-154-5p. Its differential expression effects on the progress and metastasis of cervical cancer were analyzed using cell culture and animal models. Result(s): MiR-154-5p showed low expression in cervical cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-154-5p could markedly inhibit the proliferation, migration, and colony formation ability of SiHa cells, concomitantly leading to G1 arrest of the cell cycle, while silencing miR-154-5p triggered the opposite results. Meanwhile, overexpression of miR-154-5p restrained the growth and metastasis of cervical cancer by silencing CUL2 in vivo. Additionally, miR-154-5p reduced CUL2 level, and overexpression of CUL2 influenced the effect of miR-154-5p in cervical cancer. In conclusion, miR-154-5p restrained the growth and metastasis of cervical cancer by directly silencing CUL2.Copyright 2023 Li et al.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common and deadly cancer. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) abundance may a valuable, prognostic biomarker in low- and intermediate-risk patients. However, few technologies have demonstrated success in detecting CTCs in these populations. We prospectively collected longitudinal CTC counts from two cohorts of patients receiving treatments at our institution using a highly sensitive device that purifies CTCs using biomimetic cell rolling and dendrimer-conjugated antibodies. In patients with intermediate risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive HNSCC, elevated CTC counts were detected in 13 of 14 subjects at screening with a median of 17 CTC/ml (range 0.2-2986.5). A second cohort of non-metastatic, HPV- HNSCC subjects received cetuximab monotherapy followed by surgical resection. In this cohort, all subjects had elevated baseline CTC counts median of 73 CTC/ml (range 5.4-332.9) with statistically significant declines during treatment. Interestingly, two patients with recurrent disease had elevated CTC counts during and following treatment, which also correlated with growth of size and ki67 expression in the primary tumor. The results suggest that our device may be a valuable tool for evaluating the success of less intensive treatment regimens.Copyright © 2023

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignancy in the oral cancer threatening human health and the survival rate of OSCC has not been effectively improved in recent decades, so more effective biomarkers for the targeted therapy of OSCC are needed. Moreover, the role of CDH11 in OSCC has not been intensively investigated. We here show that the CDH11 protein and mRNA expression levels in the OSCC tissues were all significantly higher than in the non-cancerous tissues using RT-qPCR and western blot. This study also revealed that patients with higher CDH11 levels showed a higher incidence of perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis. By using data available from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress databases, overexpressed CDH11 in OSCC that associated with patients'history of alcohol, negative Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) status, perineural invasion, infiltration of multiple immune cells, and Single-cell functional states including quiescence and angiogenesis, possessed an excellent discriminatory capability in the OSCC patients. Moreover, the majority of the biological processes or pathways were significantly clustered by co-expressed genes, including extracellular matrix organization, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, carbon metabolism, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the upstream transcriptional regulation mechanism of CDH11 in OSCC was showed on a transcription factor/miRNA-mRNA network with the online tool NetworkAnalyst. Finally, frequent mutation of CDH11 was observed on a mouse OSCC model through whole-genome sequencing. CDH11 might serve as a valuable biomarker in OSCC, as it was identified to be overexpressed in OSCC and related to its clinical progression.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, genotype, and distribution of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) in women living in southeast Turkey. Materials and methods. A total of 13,300 cervical smear materials were scanned and 899 cases found to be HPV-positive were included in the study. Cases were divided into seven groups according to age (under 19 years of age, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and over 60 years old) and six groups according to HPV types (HPV type 16, HPV type 18, HPV type 16-18 association, HPV type 16-high risk (HR) association, HPV Type 18-HR association, and HPV HR [31,33,35,39,45, 51,52,56,58,59,66, and 68]). SurePath liquid-based cytology preparations were evaluated, and HPV tests were performed using real-time-polymerase chain reaction. Results. A total of 6.7% of cervical smear samples were positive for HPV DNA. The mean age of these cases was 41 years (range 15-78 years). All HPV types showed the highest rate of positivity in the 30-39 age groups. Regarding the distribution of HPV types, most of the cases were in the HPV HR group (66%). The most common atypia category detected in cytological examination was "Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance" (ASC-US) (27%). Conclusions. It was determined that the prevalence of HPV in the southeast of Turkey is lower than the world average, the most common HPV type in our region is HPV-HR, and HPV peaks at older ages compared to what has been reported for other regions of the world.Copyright © 2022 Academia Mexicana de Cirugia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphocyte telomere length (LTL)-related genetic variants may modulate LTL and affect recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP). METHODS: A total of 1013 patients with incident SCCOP were recruited and genotyped for 16 genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified TL-related polymorphisms. Of these patients, 489 had tumour HPV16 status determination. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate associations. FINDINGS: Of the 16 TL-related polymorphisms, four were significantly associated with LTL: rs1920116, rs3027234, rs6772228, and rs11125529, and the patients with putatively favourable genotypes had approximately 1.5-3 times the likelihood of shorter LTL compared with patients with the corresponding risk genotypes. Moreover, patients with one to four favourable genotypes of the four combined polymorphisms had approximately 3-11 times the likelihood of shorter LTL compared with patients with no favourable genotype. The four LTL-related polymorphisms were significantly associated with approximately 40% reduced risk (for favourable genotypes) or doubled risk (for risk genotypes) of recurrence, and similar but more pronounced associations were observed in patients with tumour HPV16-positive SCCOP. Similarly, patients with one to four risk genotypes had significantly approximately 2.5-4 times increased recurrence risk compared with patients with no risk genotype, and similar but more pronounced associations were observed in patients with tumour HPV16-positive SCCOP. INTERPRETATION: Four LTL-related polymorphisms individually or jointly modify LTL and risk of recurrence of SCCOP, particularly HPV-positive SCCOP.

AB  - Background: There are diverse lesions originating from the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and malnutrition have been identified to play a role in the development of head and neck carcinomas. Recently, fungi and viruses have been recognized as potential causes of nasal cavity and paranasal tumors. Objective(s): This study aimed at specifying the prevalence of Aspergillus and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in the epithelial tumors of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, 57 paraffin-embedded tissue samples of malignant and benign lesions of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity were evaluated for the presence of Aspergillus and HPV DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) technique with specific primers. Result(s): Despite the absence of angular hyphae (acute angle) of the fungus on histopathological slides, overall, 10 (17.54%) out of 57 paraffin-embedded samples were found to be positive for Aspergillus species. However, HPV-DNA was not found in any of the samples. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that fungal infections (especially aspergillosis) as an etiological factor can be contributed to the development of sinonasal cancer and, therefore, they should be considered in the management of patients with sinonasal cancer. In addition, PCR can provide an alternative to culture-dependent identification methods.Copyright © 2023, Author(s).

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is widely acknowledged as the most sensitive cervical cancer screening method but has limited availability in resource-limited settings, where the burden of cervical cancer is highest. Recently, HPV DNA tests have been developed for use in resource-limited settings, but they remain too costly for widespread use and require instruments that are often limited to centralized laboratories. To help meet the global need for low-cost cervical cancer screening, we developed a prototype, sample-to-answer, point-of-care test for HPV16 and HPV18 DNA. Our test relies on isothermal DNA amplification and lateral flow detection, two technologies that reduce the need for complex instrumentation. We integrated all test components into a low-cost, manufacturable platform, and performance of the integrated test was evaluated with synthetic samples, provider-collected clinical samples in a high-resource setting in the United States, and self-collected clinical samples in a low-resource setting in Mozambique. We demonstrated a clinically relevant limit of detection of 1000 HPV16 or HPV18 DNA copies per test. The test requires six user steps, yields results in 45 min, and can be performed using a benchtop instrument and minicentrifuge by minimally trained personnel. The projected per-test cost is <$5, and the projected instrumentation cost is <$1000. These results show the feasibility of a sample-to-answer, point-of-care HPV DNA test. With the inclusion of other HPV types, this test has the potential to fill a critical gap for decentralized and globally accessible cervical cancer screening.Copyright © 2023 The Authors, some rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With HPV screening the specificity of screening positives has decreased, even with a cytological triage test. Increases in colposcopies and detection of benign or low-grade dysplasia are reported, not least in older women. These results highlight the necessity to find other triage tests in HPV screening strategies, so that women can be more accurately selected for colposcopy, thus minimizing the clinically irrelevant findings. METHODS: The study included 55- to 59-year-old women who exited the screening with normal cytology, but later in a follow-up test were positive for the HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68 and had a cervical cone biopsy done. To model a screening situation with hrHPV-positive women, three different triage strategies, namely, cytology, genotyping and methylation, were performed. The study considered the effect of direct referral to colposcopy for HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and methylation for FAM19A4 and hsa-mir124-2 and/or any form of abnormal cytology. RESULTS: Seven out of 49 women aged 55-59 years with hrHPV had a cone biopsy with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. No triage method found all cases, and when comparing positive and negative predictive value and false negative rate, cytology showed better results than genotyping and methylation. CONCLUSION: This study does not support a switch in triage strategies from cytology to hrHPV genotyping and methylation for women above 55 years of age yet, but demonstrates the need for more evidence on molecular triage strategies.

AB  - The human papillomavirus E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with a different subset of host proteins, leading to dysregulation of the apoptotic, cell cycle, and signaling pathways. In this study, we identified, for the first time, that Aurora kinase B (AurB) is a bona fide interacting partner of E6. We systematically characterized the AurB-E6 complex formation and its consequences in carcinogenesis using a series of in vitro and cell-based assays. We also assessed the efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitors in halting HPV-mediated carcinogenesis using in vitro and in vivo models. We showed that AurB activity was elevated in HPV-positive cells, and this correlated positively with the E6 protein level. E6 interacted directly with AurB in the nucleus or mitotic cells. A previously unidentified region of E6, located upstream of C-terminal E6-PBM, was important for AurB-E6 complex formation. AurB-E6 complex led to reduced AurB kinase activity. However, the AurB-E6 complex increased the hTERT protein level and its telomerase activity. On the other hand, AurB inhibition led to the inhibition of telomerase activity, cell proliferation, and tumor formation, even though this may occur in an HPV-independent manner. In summary, this study dissected the molecular mechanism of how E6 recruits AurB to induce cell immortalization and proliferation, leading to the eventual cancer development. Our findings revealed that the treatment of AZD1152 exerted a non-specific anti-tumor effect. Hence, a continuous effort to seek a specific and selective inhibitor that can halt HPV-mediated carcinogenesis should be warranted.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - (1) Background: Several lines of evidence established a link between high-risk (HR) sexual behavior (SB), the persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in saliva, and the presence of oncogenic HR-HPV subtypes in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). A highly influential case-control study by D'Souza et al. comparing OPSCC patients and ENT patients with benign diseases (hospital controls) established HR-SB as a putative etiological risk factor for OPSCC. Aiming to replicate their findings in a nested case-control study of OPSCC patients and propensity score (PS)-matched unaffected controls from a large population-based German cohort study, we here demonstrate discrepant findings regarding HR-SB in OPSCC. (2) Methods: According to the main risk factors for HNSCC (age, sex, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption) PS-matched healthy controls invited from the population-based cohort study LIFE and HNSCC (including OPSCC) patients underwent interviews, using AUDIT and Fagerstrom, as well as questionnaires asking for SB categories as published. Afterwards, by newly calculating PSs for the same four risk factors, we matched each OPSCC patient with two healthy controls and compared responses utilizing chi-squared tests and logistic regression. (3) Results: The HNSCC patients and controls showed significant differences in sex distribution, chronologic age, tobacco-smoking history (pack years), and alcohol dependence (based on AUDIT score). However, PS-matching decreased the differences between OPSCC patients and controls substantially. Despite confirming that OPSCC patients were more likely to self-report their first sexual intercourse before age 18, we found no association between OPSCC and HR-SB, neither for practicing oral-sex, having an increased number of oral- or vaginal-sex partners, nor for having casual sex or having any sexually transmitted disease. (4) Conclusion(s): Our data, by showing a low prevalence of HR-SB in OPSCC patients, confirm findings from other European studies that differ substantially from North American case-control studies. HR-SB alone may not add excess risk for developing OPSCC.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Multiplex PCR can utilize limited clinical material and is more cost-effective and expected to be used for the detection of Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV-1,2). We established a multiplex TP-HSV1-HSV2 Polymerase Chain Reaction (multiplex PCR) targeting the conserved regions of the PolA gene of TP and the UL42 gene of HSV1 and HSV2 to test skin lesions of 115 patients suspected of having TP and HSV1/2 infections. The laboratory sensitivities for all 3 pathogens were 300 copies/mL. The overall clinical sensitivity and specificity in secretion samples for TP were 91.7% and 100%, for HSV1 100% and 98%, and for HSV2 89.7% and 100%, respectively. The method appears superior in patients suspected of early TP infection but negative for nontreponemal antibody testing, and the method is also useful for the differential diagnosis of new skin lesions on genital, perianal, and oral sites of patients with a history of previous syphilis.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Backgroud: Several studies showed that human papillomavirus (HPV) affects male fertility, but its impact on female fertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome is not yet clear. Method(s): Objective of this observational, prospective, cohort study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection in women candidate to IVF, and the effects of HPV infection on the kinetic of embryonic development and on IVF outcome. A total number of 457 women candidate to IVF were submitted to HR-HPV test; among them, 326 underwent their first IVF cycle and were included in the analysis on IVF results. Result(s): 8.9% of women candidate to IVF were HPV-positive, HPV16 being the most prevalent genotype. Among the infertility causes, endometriosis was significantly more frequent in HPV-positive than in negative women (31.6% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.01). Granulosa and endometrial cells resulted HPV-positive in 61% and 48% of the women having HPV-positive cervical swab, respectively. Comparing HPV-positive and negative women at their first IVF cycle, no significant difference was observed in the responsiveness to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in terms of number and maturity of retrieved oocytes, and of fertilization rate. The mean morphological embryo score was comparable in the two groups; embryos of HPV-positive women showed a quicker development in the early stages, with a significantly shorter interval between the appearance of pronuclei and their fusion. In the following days, embryo kinetic was comparable in the two groups until the early blastocyst stage, when embryos of HPV-positive women became significantly slower than those of HPV-negative women. Overall, these differences did not affect live birth rate/started cycle, that was comparable in HPV-positive and negative women (22.2 and 28.1%, respectively). Conclusion(s): (a) the prevalence of HPV infection in women candidate to IVF is similar to that observed in the general female population of the same age range; (b) HPV infection migrates along the female genital apparatus, involving also the endometrium and the ovary, and perhaps participates in the genesis of pelvic endometriosis; (c) HPV slightly affects the developmental kinetic of in vitro-produced embryos, but does not exert an effect on live birth rate.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Host-cell DNA methylation analysis can be used to triage women with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive self-collected cervicovaginal samples, but current data are restricted to under-/never-screened women and referral populations. This study evaluated triage performance in women who were offered primary HPV self-sampling for cervical cancer screening. Method(s): Self-collected samples from 593 HPV-positive women who participated in a primary HPV self-sampling trial (IMPROVE study; NTR5078), were tested for the DNA methylation markers ASCL1 and LHX8 using quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR (qMSP). The diagnostic performance for CIN3 and cervical cancer (CIN3 +) was evaluated and compared with that of paired HPV-positive clinician-collected cervical samples. Result(s): Significantly higher methylation levels were found in HPV-positive self-collected samples of women with CIN3 + than control women with no evidence of disease (P values <0.0001). The marker panel ASCL1/LHX8 yielded a sensitivity for CIN3 + detection of 73.3% (63/86; 95% CI 63.9-82.6%), with a corresponding specificity of 61.1% (310/507; 95% CI 56.9-65.4%). The relative sensitivity for detecting CIN3+ was 0.95 (95% CI 0.82-1.10) for self-collection versus clinician-collection, and the relative specificity was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.90). Conclusion(s): The ASCL1/LHX8 methylation marker panel constitutes a feasible direct triage method for the detection of CIN3 + in HPV-positive women participating in routine screening by self-sampling.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Polyomaviruses have both structural and functional similarities with papillomaviruses. Accordingly, their role in human papillomavirus (HPV) associated malignancies has been studied with conflicting results. Our goal was to disclose any association between BK (BKPyV) and/or JC (JCPyV) polyomavirus serology and HPV data derived from Finnish women (327) in a 6-year prospective follow-up. Method(s): Glutathione S-transferase fusion-protein-capture (ELISA) in combination with fluorescent bead technology was used to analyze antibodies to BKPyV and JCPyV. In the longitudinal setting, BKPyV or JCPyV serostatus was related to i) oral- and ii) genital low (LR)- and high risk (HR) HPV DNA detection, iii) HPV16 persistence at both these sites, iv) results of the Pap (Papanicolaou) smear taken at baseline, and v) development of incident CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) during the follow-up. Result(s): Being BKPyV or JCPyV seropositive was not significantly associated with HPV seropositivity to either LR- or HR-genotypes, genital- or oral HPV DNA positivity, persistence of genital- or oral HPV16 infection, grade of Pap smear, or development of incident CIN. Discussion(s): Thus, the present study could not provide any confirmation to the concept that co-infections by HPyV and HPV have interactions that impact on the clinical manifestations or outcomes of HPV infections either in the genital tract or in the oral mucosa.Copyright © 2023 Laine, Waterboer, Syrjanen, Grenman, Louvanto and Syrjanen.

AB  - Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections is necessary for the development of cervical cancers. An increasing number of retrospective studies have found the depletion of Lactobacillus microbiota in the cervico-vagina facilitate HPV infection and might be involved in viral persistence and cancer development. However, there have been no reports confirming the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus microbiota isolated from cervico-vaginal samples of HPV clearance in women. Using cervico-vaginal samples from HPV persistent infection and clearance in women, this study investigated the local immune properties in cervical mucosa. As expected, type I interferons, such as IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, and TLR3 globally downregulated in HPV+ persistence group. Luminex cytokine/chemokine panel analysis revealed that L. jannaschii LJV03, L. vaginalis LVV03, L. reuteri LRV03, and L. gasseri LGV03 isolated from cervicovaginal samples of HPV clearance in women altered the host's epithelial immune response, particularly L. gasseri LGV03. Furthermore, L. gasseri LGV03 enhanced the poly (I:C)-induced production of IFN by modulating the IRF3 pathway and attenuating poly (I:C)-induced production of proinflammatory mediators by regulating the NF-kappaB pathway in Ect1/E6E7 cells, indicating that L. gasseri LGV03 keeps the innate system alert to potential pathogens and reduces the inflammatory effects during persistent pathogen infection. L. gasseri LGV03 also markedly inhibited the proliferation of Ect1/E6E7 cells in a zebrafish xenograft model, which may be attributed to an increased immune response mediated by L. gasseri LGV03.Copyright © 2023

AB  - Objective:Cervical cancer is a common preventable cancer among African women living with HIV (WLWH). Molecular diagnostics for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes are standard components of cervical cancer screening in resource-rich countries but not in resource-limited settings. We evaluated HR-HPV genotypes among women with and without HIV in four African countries to inform cervical cancer preventive strategies. Method(s):The African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) enrolled participants with and without HIV at 12 clinics in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria. Cervical cytobrush specimens from women were genotyped for 14 HR-HPV types using the multiplex Seegene Anyplex real-time PCR assay. Robust Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with HR-HPV in WLWH. Result(s):From January 2015 to March 2020, 868 WLWH and 134 women living without HIV (WLWoH) were tested for HR-HPV with prevalence of 50.9 and 38.1%, respectively (P = 0.007). Among WLWH, 844 (97.4%) were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced and 772 (89.7%) virally suppressed 1000 copies/ml or less. The most frequent HR-HPV types among WLWH were HPV-16 (13.5%), HPV-52 (9.5%), and HPV-35 (9.3%). HR-HPV infection was more common among Tanzanian WLWH (adjusted RR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.44, P = 0.012). Also, WLWH with CD4+T cells of less than 200 cell/mul had 1.51-fold increased risk of having HR-HPV (95% CI 1.23-1.86, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s):HR-HPV was common in WLWH in four African countries, particularly among women with low CD4+cell count. Scale up of HPV vaccines and development of vaccines with broader activity against less common HR-HPV types may improve cervical cancer prevention in Africa.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Therapeutic vaccination is one of the most effective immunotherapeutic approaches, second only to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which have already been approved for clinical use. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are heterogenous epithelial tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, and a significant proportion of these tumors tend to exhibit unfavorable therapeutic responses to the existing treatment options. Comprehending the immunopathology of these tumors and choosing an appropriate immunotherapeutic maneuver seems to be a promising avenue for solving this problem. The current review provides a detailed overview of the strategies, targets, and candidates for therapeutic vaccination in HNSCC. The classical principle of inducing a potent, antigen-specific, cell-mediated cytotoxicity targeting a specific tumor antigen seems to be the most effective mechanism of therapeutic vaccination, particularly against the human papilloma virus positive subset of HNSCC. However, approaches such as countering the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of HNSCC and immune co-stimulatory mechanisms have also been explored recently, with encouraging results.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and stromal CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+TILs) serve important roles in antitumor immune responses to radiotherapy. This study aimed to elucidate the association between TMB, CD8+TILs, and clinical factors in patients with cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy. Method(s): Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with definitive radiotherapy, and with available somatic mutation data and immunohistochemical staining data from identical tumor tissues, were enrolled retrospectively. The association between TMB and/or CD8+TIL density and patient characteristics, mutation profiles, and treatment outcome was analyzed. Result(s): The study analyzed 44 patients (median follow-up period, 61 months). There was no significant correlation between TMB and CD8+TIL density, or between TMB or CD8+TIL density and patient characteristics. TMB-high or CD8+TIL density-low status was associated with worse overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival; the predictive value of these factors became greater when used in combination. TMB-high or CD8+TIL density-high status was associated with ARID1A mutations. Conclusion(s): These data indicate independence of TMB and CD8+TIL density and the involvement of ARID1A alterations in antitumor immune responses in patients with cervical cancers treated with radiotherapy, warranting further mechanistic research and prospective validation.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Objective: Early and routine detection of HPV which is responsible for most cervical cancers in women infected with HIV could not only improve their prognosis but can help in reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with such populations. The HPV infections are caused by a variety of HPV types including HPV-16. This study investigated the prevalence of HPV-16 in HIV-infected women in Abakaliki, Nigeria. Material(s) and Method(s): Whole blood samples (aliquots of 10 mL) were aseptically collected from HIV-positive women (n = 100) who attended a tertiary hospital in Abakaliki, Nigeria for antiretroviral therapy and counselling. Also, 60 HIV-negative women were included as a control group. All samples were investigated by ELISA and PCR for the detection of HPV-16. Result(s): A high prevalence of HPV antibodies (HPV IgG) in the HIV-1 positive women was reported. It was observed that there was a significant association of HPV-16 infection with age and sexual activity among the HIV-1 infected women. The prevalence of high risk HPV-16 (8.8%) in the patient's blood samples was reported in HIV-positive women. Conclusion(s): Given the prevalence of HPV-16 and HPV antibodies reported in this study, it could be concluded that HIV-1 infection could increase the susceptibility of women to HPV-16 infection, particularly among those already living with the immunodeficiency disease (HIV-1).Copyright © 2023 Euslar Nnenna Onu et al.

AB  - Although cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions are considered to be not randomly distributed across the cervix, but predominantly in the anterior wall, the clinicopathological etiology remains unknown. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between quantitatively measured area of CIN2/3 and cervical cancer associated factors by retrospective cohort study. We analyzed 235 consecutive therapeutic conization specimens dissected as a single intact section to determine CIN2/3 area and its correlation with both clinical risk factors including human papillomavirus (HPV) status (single or multiple infection) and uterine position defined by transvaginal ultrasound. Cervical wall was classified into three groups: anterior: (11, 12, 1, and 2 o'clock), posterior (5, 6, 7, and 8 o'clock) and lateral (3, 4, 9, and 10 o'clock). Multiple regression revealed that younger age and HPV16 status were significantly correlated with CIN2/3 area (p = 0.0224 and p = 0.0075, respectively). The Jonckheere-Terpstra test showed a significant trend: CIN2/3 area was highest in the single HPV16 group, followed by the multiple HPV16 group and the non-HPV16 group (p < 0.0001). CIN2/3 area in the anterior wall was statistically significantly larger than the posterior and lateral wall (p = 0.0059 and p = 0.0107, respectively). CIN2/3 area in the anterior wall was significantly greater with anteversion-anteflexion than retroversion-retroflexion (p = 0.0485), whereas CIN2/3 area in the posterior wall was significantly larger with retroversion-retroflexion than anteversion-anteflexion (p = 0.0394). In conclusion, the topographical distribution of CIN2/3 area is closely associated with patient age, high-risk HPV status, especially single HPV16 infection and uterine position.

AB  - Background: Respiratory recurrent papillomatosis (RRP) is a fatal disease with no known cure. In severe RRP cases, systemic bevacizumab (SB) could be used as adjuvant therapy. Objective(s): This study aims to determine the extent and type of evidence in relation to the clinical outcomes of RRP after SB treatment. Method(s): Participants with RRP of all genders are included in this scoping review. There were no exclusion criteria (country, language, or document type). The information sources included experimental, quasi-experimental, and analytical observational studies. Unpublished data will not be covered, but gray literature was covered. Screening, paper selection, and data extraction were all done by two independent reviewers. This procedure was performed blindly. Result(s): Of the 175 unique records found, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Fourteen studies were included after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty-four patients in these studies came from the United States, India, Germany, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and Spain. In total, 17 and 34 patients were below 18 years old and were adults respectively. The most commonly reported dose was 10 mg/kg, which was received by 25 (73.5%) patients. According to reports, 58.8% of patients completed the questionnaire. Twelve (35%) patients did not require a repeat surgery. The time interval between surgical procedures has increased for patients who require them. Conclusion(s): SB may be a promissory treatment and control option for RRP. More research is needed to evaluate the efficiency and adverse effects in various populations.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: The 2020 American Cancer Society guidelines preferred primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening for cervical cancer prevention. Studies investigating the role of cytology in detection of cervical precancer/cancer have focused on high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse interpretations. Here, we have examined the significance of all those cytology results that require histologic follow-up as per the current management guidelines, regardless of the HPV test result. Material(s) and Method(s): A database search (September 2010 to December 2019) retrieved cervical Papanicolaou tests with any of the following interpretations: >= atypical squamous cells - cannot exclude HSIL or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL cannot be excluded, and >= atypical glandular cells, not otherwise specified and its subcategories. Of these, those with concurrent negative HPV test result were included for further analysis. For this cohort, relevant clinical history and histologic follow-up (within 1 year) were recorded. Result(s): The study cohort comprised 763 patients. Of them, 586 (76.8%) patients had histologic follow-up: 53 (9.0%) had >= HSIL/adenocarcinoma in situ; of which, 43 (81.1%) had prior abnormal cytology/histology/not otherwise specified history and/or HPV positivity, and 66 (11.3%) had HPV-unassociated neoplasia; of which, 60 (90.9%) had a known diagnosis or clinical signs/symptoms of the disease. Conclusion(s): With widespread adoption of risk-based approach to management, the role of cytology, by itself, will likely diminish in the detection of HPV-associated lesions. Additional data regarding the role of cytology in the screening of patients with no/unknown/limited history and in the detection/management of HPV-independent lesions may be helpful for designing future screening guidelines.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Cytopathology

AB  - Objective: To explore the ability of PAX1 methylation (PAX1m) to predict the pathological upgrade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) before cold knife conization (CKC). Method(s): A total of 218 women that underwent colposcopy-directed biopsy (CDB) pathology for the confirmation of CIN2 and CIN3 between December 2020 to September 2021 were enrolled in this study. The methylation levels of PAX1 (DELTACpPAX1) were determined by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP). Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify the optimal cut-off value of DELTACpPAX1 for predicting the pathological upgrade of disease. Result(s): In the CDB-confirmed CIN2 group, 36% of CIN2 was found to have pathologically upgraded to CIN3 and 30% regressed to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and below, and none of CIN2 upgraded to early-stage cervical cancer (ESCC) after CKC. In the CDB-confirmed CIN3 group, 19.5% (23/118) of CDB-confirmed CIN3 were pathologically upgraded to ESCC after CKC. Regardless of CIN2 or CIN3, the DELTACpPAX1 level of women with upgraded pathology after CKC was significantly lower than that of women with degraded pathology. The optimal CpPAX1 cut-off value in predicting CIN3 to be upgraded to ESCC after CKC was 6.360 and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.814, with similar sensitivity (78.3%) and higher specificity (84.2%) than cytology>=LSIL (Se:78.3%;Sp:58.9%) and HPV16/18 positive (Se:73.9%;Sp:46.3%) patients. Conclusion(s): PAX1m could be a promising auxiliary marker in predicting the pathological upgrade of CIN before CKC. We found that if the Cp PAX1 cut-off value is lower than 6.360, it is highly suggestive of invasive cervical cancer.Copyright © 2023 Li, Zhao, Zhao, Li, Wang, Luo, Tang, Guo and Wei.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of the tongue is increasing in the younger population without traditional risk habits that lead researchers to find other related factors such as diet and viruses, especially human papillomavirus (HPV). It is noteworthy that many OSCCs develop from oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Correct diagnosis and timely management of OPMDs may help to prevent malignant transformation, and therefore it is worth seeing the involvement of HPV in OPMDs and oral cancers, as the preventive and curative measures in HPV-induced cancer types are different from the conventional types of OPMDs and OSCCs. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify a relationship between HPV and p16 in OPMDs and compare it with OSCC. METHODS: This study was conducted on 83 cases of known OSCCs and OPMDs (oral submucous fibrosis, leukoplakia, and oral lichen planus). Assays, such as polymerized chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR, were carried out for HPV and p16 . The results were compared with clinical information and with the literature. The results were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 for windows. RESULTS: P16 expression was mostly seen in males than in female patients. Out of 21 cases of keratosis with dysplasia, 19% expressed p16 . Of 26 oral lichen planus patients, 29% showed the p16 gene with immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, a high percentage of OSF cases expressed p16 (48.27%). Minimal expression was observed in OSCC (6.25%). HPV DNA was detected in 2.4% of the total sample. Both p16 and HPV were detected in a single case of OSCC. OPMDs expressed a significant amount of the p16 gene by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR technique when compared with malignant lesions, suggesting a possible inactivation of the p16 gene. HPV and p16 are mostly negative in our OSCC sample, exhibiting low prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: OPMDs expressed a significant amount of the p16 gene when compared with malignant lesions, suggesting a possible inactivation of the p16 gene. Although OSF expressed p16 , HPV was not detected, suggesting that over-expression could be independent of HPV. OSCC shows low HPV prevalence.

AB  - Introduction: The enzymes Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) und 3 (RIPK3) as well as the protein Mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (pMLKL) play a role in the signaling cascade of necroptosis. This is a form of programmed cell death which is caspase-independent. High-risk human papilloma virus infection can inhibit necroptosis. Thereby, a persistent infection and consequently the development of cervical cancer can be triggered. Aim of this study was the analysis of the expression of RIPK1, RIPK3 and pMLKL in cervical cancer tissue and the evaluation of its prognostic value on overall survival, progression-free survival and additional clinical parameters. Method(s): The expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and pMLKL in cervical cancer tissue microarrays of n = 250 patients was analyzed immunohistochemically. Further, the effect of C2 ceramide on several cervical cancer cell lines (CaSki, HeLa, SiHa) was examined. C2 ceramide is a biologically active short-chain ceramide that induces necroptosis in human luteal granulosa cells. Result(s): Significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival rates could be detected in cervical cancer patients expressing nuclear RIPK1 or RIPK3 alone or simultaneously (RIPK1 and RIPK3). Cell viability and proliferation was reduced through C2 ceramide stimulation of cervical cancer cells. Simultaneous stimulation of C2 ceramide and the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, or the RIPK1-inhibitor necrostatin-1, partly reversed the negative effect of C2 ceramide on cell viability. This observation could imply that caspase-dependent and -independent forms of cell death, including necroptosis, can occur. AnnexinV-FITC apoptosis staining induced a significant increase in apoptotic cells in CaSki and SiHa cells. The stimulation of CaSki cells with C2 ceramide led to a significant percentual increase in necrotic/intermediate (dying) cells after stimulation with C2 ceramide. In addition, after stimulation with C2 ceramide, CaSki and HeLa cells live cell imaging showed morphological changes which are common for necroptosis. Discussion(s): In conclusion, RIPK1 and RIPK3 are independent positive predictors for overall survival and progression-free survival in cervical cancer patients. C2 ceramide can reduce cell viability and proliferation in cervical cancer cells by inducing most likely both apoptosis and necroptosis.Copyright © 2023 Vogelsang, Kast, Bagnjuk, Eubler, Jeevanandan, Schmoeckel, Trebo, Topalov, Mahner, Mayr, Mayerhofer, Jeschke and Vattai.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical screening increases diagnosis of precancer and reduces the incidence of cervical cancer more than cytology alone. However, real-world evidence from diverse practice settings is lacking for the United States (U.S.) to support clinician adoption of primary HPV screening. Using a population-based registry, which captures all cervical cytology (with or without HPV testing) and all cervical biopsies, we conducted a real-world evidence study of screening in women aged 30 to 64 years across the entire state of New Mexico. Negative cytology was used to distinguish cotests from reflex HPV tests. A total of 264 198 cervical screening tests (with exclusions based on clinical history) were recorded as the first screening test between 2014 and 2017. Diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 or 3 or greater (CIN2+, CIN3+) from 2014 to 2019 were the main outcomes. Of cytology-negative screens, 165 595 (67.1%) were cotests and 4.8% of these led to biopsy within 2 years vs 3.2% in the cytology-only group. Among cytology-negative, HPV tested women, 347 of 398 (87.2%) CIN2+ cases were diagnosed in HPV-positive women, as were 147 of 164 (89.6%) CIN3+ cases. Only 29/921 (3.2%) CIN3+ and 67/1964 (3.4%) CIN2+ cases were diagnosed in HPV-negative, cytology-positive women with biopsies. Under U.S. opportunistic screening, across a diversity of health care delivery practices, and in a population suffering multiple disparities, we show adding HPV testing to cytology substantially increased the yield of CIN2+ and CIN3+. CIN3+ was rarely diagnosed in HPV-negative women with abnormal cytology, supporting U.S. primary HPV-only screening.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in other anatomical sites besides the uterine cervix is unknown in East Africa. Here, we assessed the prevalence and concordance of HPVs in different anatomical sites in HIV concordant couples in Rwanda. Method(s): Fifty HIV-positive concordant male-female couples at the HIV clinic at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali in Rwanda were interviewed, swabbed from the oral cavity (OC), oropharynx (OP), anal canal (AC), vagina (V), uterine cervix (UC) and penis. A pap smear test and a self-collected vaginal swab (Vself) were taken. Twelve high-risk (HR)-HPVs were analyzed. Result(s): HR-HPVs occurred in 10%/12% in OC, 10%/0% in OP and 2%/24% in AC (p = 0.002) in men and women, respectively. HR-HPVs occurred in 24% of UC, 32% of Vself, 30% of V and 24% of P samples. Only 22.2% of all HR-HPV infections were shared by both partners (kappa -0.34 +/- 0.11; p = 0.004). The type-specific HR-HPV concordance was significant between male to female OC-OC (kappa 0.56 +/- 0.17), V-VSelf (kappa 0.70 +/- 0.10), UC-V (kappa 0.54 +/- 0.13), UC-Vself (kappa 0.51 +/- 0.13) and UC-female AC (kappa 0.42 +/- 0.15). Conclusion(s): HPV infections are prevalent in HIV-positive couples in Rwanda but concordance within couples is low. Vaginal self-sampling for HPV is representative of cervical HPV status.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the roles of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 mutations in sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) and sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC). Samples were collected from 20 cases with IP, 7 with IP and squamous cell carcinoma (IP-SCC), and 20 with SNSCC and examined for HPV infection and EGFR exon 20 mutations. Low- or high-risk HPV DNA was observed in 25% of IP, 57.1% of IP-SCC, and 35% of SNSCC cases. Transcriptionally active HR-HPV infections in IP-SCC and SNSCC, accompanied by p16 overexpression, were observed in 28.5% and 25% of cases, respectively. Heterozygous EGFR exon 20 amino acid insertions (ex20ins), located between amino acids 768-774, were observed in 45% of IP, 28.5% of IP-SCC, and 0% of SNSCC and chronic sinusitis cases. EGFR phosphorylation sites were located at tyrosine (Y) 845, Y1068, Y1086, and Y1197 and induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation. The phosphorylation pattern of EGFR with ex20ins resembled that of HPV-related SNSCC and oropharyngeal cancer. The transcriptionally active HR-HPV infection and ex20ins might be responsible for the pathogenesis of IP-SCC cases with different fashions. Since IP-SCC might be a multifactorial disease, further investigation is needed to understand IP-SCC etiology.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Condyloma acuminatum (CA) is a sexually transmitted disease characterized by the anomalous proliferation of keratinocytes caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Fu Fang Gang Liu liquid (FFGL) is an effective externally administered prescription used to treat CA; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to identify and experimentally validate the major active ingredients and prospective targets of FFGL. Method(s): Network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and enrichment analysis were used to identify the active ingredients and prospective targets of FFGL, which were confirmed through subsequent experimental validation using mass spectrometry, molecular docking, western blotting, and in vitro assays. Result(s): The network pharmacology analysis revealed that FFGL contains a total of 78 active compounds, which led to the screening of 610 compound-related targets. Among them, 59 overlapped with CA targets and were considered to be targets with potential therapeutic effects. The protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that protein kinase B (Akt) serine/threonine kinase 1 was a potential therapeutic target. To further confirm this result, we performed ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) assays on HPV 18+ cells after FFGL exposure and conducted enrichment analyses on the differentially expressed genes that were screened. The enrichment analysis results indicated that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway may be a key pathway through which FFGL exerts its effects. Further in vitro experiments revealed that FFGL significantly inhibited the activity of HPV 18+ cells and reduced PI3K and Akt protein levels. A rescue experiment indicated that the reduction in cell viability induced by FFGL was partially restored after the administration of activators of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We further screened two active components of FFCL that may be efficacious in the treatment of CA: periplogenin and periplocymarin. The molecular docking experiments showed that these two compounds exhibited good binding activity to Akt1. Conclusion(s): FFGL reduced HPV 18+ cell viability by inhibiting key proteins in the PI3K/Akt pathway; this pathway may represent an essential mechanism through which FFGL treats CA. Periplogenin and periplocymarin may play a significant role in this process.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are often asymptomatic, but some of the >200 HPV genotypes confer a high risk for precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Current clinical management of HPV infections relies on reliable nucleic acid testing detection and genotyping. We prospectively compared nucleic acid extraction without and with prior centrifugation enrichment for detecting and genotyping HPV in cervical swabs with atypical squamous or glandular cells. Consecutive swabs were analyzed from 45 patients with atypical squamous or glandular cells. Nucleic acids were extracted in parallel using three procedures, Abbott-M2000, Roche-MagNA-Pure-96 Large-Volume Kit without (Roche-MP-large) and with prior centrifugation (Roche-MP-large/spin) and tested using Seegene-Anyplex-II HPV28. In total, 54 HPV-genotypes were detected in 45 samples, 51 by Roche-MP-large/spin, 48 by Abbott-M2000 and 42 by Roche-MP-large. The overall concordance was 80% for detecting any HPV and 74% for specific HPV-genotypes. Roche-MP-large/spin and Abbott-M2000 showed the highest concordance for HPV detection (88.9%; kappa 0.78), and genotyping (88.5%). Two and more HPV-genotypes were detected in 15 samples, often with one HPV being more abundant. Dilution series confirmed the specific detection of multiple HPV-genotypes and their relative abundance. In 285 consecutive follow-up samples extracted by Roche-MP-large/spin, the top three detected genotypes were the high-risk HPV16, HPV53, HPV56 and the low-risk HPV42, HPV54 and HPV61. Rate and breadth of HPV detection in cervical swabs depends on extraction protocols being highest after centrifugation/enrichment. As multivalent HPV-vaccine coverage increases, detecting the evolving HPV virome depends on improved extraction and broader genotype coverage.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Aims: Recently, YAP1 fusion genes have been demonstrated in eccrine poroma and porocarcinoma, and the diagnostic use of YAP1 immunohistochemistry has been highlighted in this setting. In other organs, loss of YAP1 expression can reflect YAP1 rearrangement or transcriptional repression, notably through RB1 inactivation. In this context, our objective was to re-evaluate the performance of YAP1 immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of poroma and porocarcinoma. Methods and Results: The expression of the C-terminal part of the YAP1 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 543 cutaneous epithelial tumours, including 27 poromas, 14 porocarcinomas and 502 other cutaneous tumours. Tumours that showed a lack of expression of YAP1 were further investigated for Rb by immunohistochemistry and for fusion transcripts by real-time PCR (YAP1::MAML2 and YAP1::NUTM1). The absence of YAP1 expression was observed in 24 cases of poroma (89%), 10 porocarcinoma (72%), 162 Merkel cell carcinoma (98%), 14 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (15%), one trichoblastoma and one sebaceoma. Fusions of YAP1 were detected in only 16 cases of poroma (n = 66%), 10 porocarcinoma (71%) all lacking YAP1 expression, and in one sebaceoma. The loss of Rb expression was detected in all cases except one of YAP1-deficient SCC (n = 14), such tumours showing significant morphological overlap with porocarcinoma. In-vitro experiments in HaCat cells showed that RB1 knockdown resulted in repression of YAP1 protein expression. Conclusion(s): In addition to gene fusion, we report that transcriptional repression of YAP1 can be observed in skin tumours with RB1 inactivation, including MCC and a subset of SCC.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: This study was aimed to analyze the research status and development trend of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), focusing on the field of programmed cell death of CSCC, and providing suggestions for the research of CSCC. Method(s): The publications related to CSCC and CSCC programmed cell death were searched in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database, and timespan was set from 2012 to middle 2022. Research trends, authors, major country collaborations, research institutions, representative journals, publishers, and keywords were analyzed with CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Result(s): After screening, a total of 3656 publications on CSCC and 156 publications on CSCC cell programmed death were obtained. The number of published articles increased gradually with the years. The United States ranked first in terms of the number of published papers. Research in this field had focused on dermatology. Most of the institutions in both regions were from European and American countries. Harvard University was the most prolific institution. Wiley was the most prolific publisher. The popular keywords for programmed cell death in CSCC were cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, diagnosis, pd 1, head, nivolumab and risk. Keywords in CSCC field were divided into 7 clusters: cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, sentinel lymph node biopsy, skin cancer, B-Raf Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase (BRAF) inhibitor and human Papillomaviruses, and P63 expression. Squamous cell carcinoma, cancer, head and expression were the most popular keywords. The popular keywords for programmed cell death in CSCC were cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, diagnosis, pd 1, head, nivolumab and risk. Conclusion(s): This study analyzed the research status of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and programmed cell death from 2012 to middle 2022. Understanding research status and hotspots can help scholars, countries and policymakers to better understand the background and research frontier of CSCC, and guide further research directions.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Guo, Wang and Li.

AB  - Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes genital and oropharyngeal cancers worldwide. There are significant gaps exist in the data on HPV genotype prevalence in this part of the country. HPV vaccination is one of the best preventive methods available currently. HPV genotyping plays an important role in the selection of appropriate vaccines and monitoring vaccine efficacy and coverage. The present study aimed to determine the HPV genotype prevalence and to estimate the potential impact of HPV vaccines on invasive cervical cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 204 cervical biopsy samples collected from symptomatic women were subjected to an in-house designed and standardised nested multiplex PCR (NM-PCR) assay. The NM-PCR was designed to detect 38 Mucosal HPV types as a pooled result and genotyping of 15 HPV types. Further, the HPV genotype data was used to estimate the HPV vaccine bivalent, quadrivalent and nonavalent impact on the population using a mathematical formula. Result(s): Out of 204 samples 188 were subjected to HPV-nested PCR. A total of 163 (86.7%) samples were positive for at least one HPV type. Multiple genotypes were identified in 30% of samples processed. HPV-16 (85.3%) was the most frequently detected genotype followed by HPV-18 (13.5%) and HPV-33 (11.0%). Other genotypes were observed less frequently. Based on the HPV prevalence observed in the study a mathematical model estimated the efficacy of bivalent, quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines were 76.1%, 76.7%, and 91.1% (average) respectively. Conclusion(s): HPV-16 was the most prevalent (>85%) genotype detected in this study. Multiple infections observed in 30% of samples were quite high as compared to the majority of national, and global reference (15-25.4%) data. The Mathematical model showed that a nonavalent vaccine would give better protection.Copyright © 2022 Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is a common cancer in women caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (Hr-HPV). Many potential biomarkers have been proposed for precancerous lesions and cancer diagnosis and some of these markers studied for prognosis. This study determined potential biomarkers for cervical cancer diagnosis in regard to HPV genotype by using isobaric labeling quantitative proteomics. Method(s): in the current study, there were 75 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) uterine cervical samples that used to determine the 14 HPV genotypes and the viral load of each genotype was determined. The tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic work was performed on four FFPE samples of cervical cancer and four FFPE of control samples. The validation of biomarkers from cervical proteome were evaluated using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing. Result(s): The most frequent HPV genotype among all other genotypes was HPV 16. There were 2753 proteins quantified by TMT and 336 of these proteins had significant differential abundances. KPNA2, MCM2, COL1A1, and DCN were selected based on functional enrichment analysis and validated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing. The staining of IHC confirmed the upregulation of KPNA2 and MCM2 expression in cervical neoplasia and the downregulation of DCN and COL1A1 in some cervical cancer group subjects. Conclusion(s): The KPNA2 marker was compared to other previously reported biomarkers and is a putative biomarker to be validated in further studies, specifically the relationship with HPV load.Copyright © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Introduction & Objectives: Most data on prognostic factors for penile cancer (PC) are based on small cohort sizes, and even meta-analyses are limited in patient numbers. Therefore, there is still a lack of evidence for clinical decision-making. About 50% of PC are HPV-associated, but the data on the prognostic role of the HPV-status are contradictory. In addition, the prognostic value of histological subtypes is still unclear. The aim of this retrospective multicentric study was the evaluation of clinically relevant parameters for differentiation of prognosis. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical data and tissue samples from 268 patients with PC from Germany, Russia and Portugal were collected. For each sample, TNM, histological subtype and grading were re-evaluated. HPV-Status was determined by genotyping and p16-immunostaining. Survival data were analysed by Kaplan-Meier estimator, log rank test and uni- and multivariate analysis using Cox regression model. Result(s): In multivariate analysis, pN2-3 was significantly associated with worse metastasis-free (MFS), cancer specific (CS), and overall survival (OS) (p = <0.001). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was a significant parameter for CS (p = 0.005) and OS (p = 0.007), but not for MFS (p = 0.346). Concerning T-stage, MFS was significantly different only between pT1b and pT1a (p = 0.017), whereas no difference in CS and OS was found for T-stages. pT1b-tumors showed a worse outcome compared to pT2 in CS and OS. Grading (for OS, CS and MFS) and perineural invasion (for OS and CS) were significant in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. In pN0-patients, LVI was a significant prognostic parameter for lower MFS (p = 0.032). Neither in the total cohort (p = 0.804 for CS, 0.394 for OS) nor in the usual type (p = 0.688 for CS, 0.841 for OS), HPV-status was associated with prognosis. Histological subtypes had an impact on prognosis, which was worse in basaloid carcinomas, but without reaching statistical significance. Conclusion(s): Lymphatic involvement, both in terms of positive lymph nodes and LVI, is the most significant prognostic parameter in penile cancer. Even nodal negative patients with LVI are on a higher risk of metastasis. Hence the worse prognosis in pT1b patients seems to be due to the inclusion of LVI as an independent prognostic factor in T-stage, questioning the definition of the pT1b-category. Histological subtype should always be reported, whereas HPV-status alone seems to be without prognostic relevance. LVI should be considered as an important factor in the decision making after treatment of the primary tumor.Copyright © 2023 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the main etiological factor for the development of cervical cancer. HPV 18 is the second most frequent type, accounting for up to 65% of all cases. HPV intratypic variation may influence the potential for progression to invasive cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of human papillomavirus 18 intratypic variants in cervical cancer samples from women in the state of Maranhao, Brazil. Method(s): The study included 118 women over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Tumor fragments were collected and subjected to DNA extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for HPV detection using the PGMY09/11 and GP+5/6 primers. Positive samples were submitted to automated sequencing for viral genotyping. To determine the HPV 18 lineages, positive samples were submitted to PCR, using specific primers to amplify the LCR and E6 regions of HPV 18 virus. Result(s): HPV was present in 88 women (73.3%). Of those, 48 (54%) were HPV 16, the most prevalent, followed by 12 (13.6%) HPV 18. Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma was predominant (79.1%). Among the HPV 18 variants identified, 10 (80%) belonged to lineage A, and sublineages A1, A2, A3, and A4. Two (29%) HPV 18 B variant was also detected, with the sublineages B1 and B2. In this study, the C variant was not found. There was no statistically significant association between the HPV 18 lineages found and sociodemographic and lifestyle variables (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): A higher frequency of HPV 16 and 18 were found in women with cervical cancer in the state of Maranhao, Brazil, with a high prevalence of the lineage A among women with HPV 18.Copyright © 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia

AB  - Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cancers are global health challenge. Insufficient comprehension of these cancers has impeded the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Bioinformatics empowered us to investigate these cancers from new entry points. Method(s): DNA methylation data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) and anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) were analyzed to identify the significantly altered pathways. Through analyses integrated with RNA sequencing data of genes in these pathways, genes with strongest correlation to the TNM staging of CESC was identified and their correlations with overall survival in patients were assessed. To find a potential promising drug, correlation analysis of gene expression levels and compound sensitivity was performed. In vitro experiments were conducted to validate these findings. We further performed molecular docking experiments to explain our findings. Result(s): Significantly altered pathways included immune, HPV infection, oxidative stress, ferroptosis and necroptosis. 10 hub genes in these pathways (PSMD11, RB1, SAE1, TAF15, TFDP1, CORO1C, JOSD1, CDC42, KPNA2 and NUP62) were identified, in which only CDC42 high expression was statistically significantly correlated with overall survival (Hazard Ratio: 1.6, P = 0.045). Afatinib was then screened out to be tested. In vitro experiments exhibited that the expression level of CDC42 was upregulated in HaCaT/A431 cells transfected with HPV E6 and E7, and the inhibitory effect of afatinib on proliferation was enhanced after transfection. CDC42-GTPase-effector interface-EGFR-afatinib was found to be a stable complex with a highest ZDOCK score of 1264.017. Conclusion(s): We identified CDC42 as a pivotal gene in the pathophysiology of HPV-related cancers. The upregulation of CDC42 could be a signal for afatinib treatment and the mechanism in which may be an increased affinity of EGFR to afatinib, inferred from a high stability in the quaternary complex of CDC42-GTPase-effector interface-EGFR-afatinib.Copyright © 2023 Wei, Li, Anand, French, Wattad, Clanner-Engelshofen and Reinholz.

AB  - The membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger ubiquitin ligase MARCHF8 is a human homolog of the viral ubiquitin ligases Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus K3 and K5 that promote host immune evasion. Previous studies have shown that MARCHF8 ubiquitinates several immune receptors, such as the major histocompatibility complex II and CD86. While human papillomavirus (HPV) does not encode any ubiquitin ligase, the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 are known to regulate host ubiquitin ligases. Here, we report that MARCHF8 expression is upregulated in HPV-positive head and neck cancer (HNC) patients but not in HPV-negative HNC patients compared to normal individuals. The MARCHF8 promoter is highly activated by HPV oncoprotein E6-induced MYC/MAX transcriptional activation. The knockdown of MARCHF8 expression in human HPV-positive HNC cells restores cell surface expression of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) death receptors, FAS, TRAILR1, and TRAIL-R2, and enhances apoptosis. MARCHF8 protein directly interacts with and ubiquitinates the TNFRSF death receptors. Further, MARCHF8 knockout in mouse oral cancer cells expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 augments cancer cell apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Our findings suggest that HPV inhibits host cell apoptosis by upregulating MARCHF8 and degrading TNFRSF death receptors in HPV-positive HNC cells.Copyright © 2023 Khalil et al.

AB  - Background: DNA methylation is an essential factor in the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer. The aim was to investigate the diagnostic value provided by methylation biomarkers of six tumor suppressor genes (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17 and ZNF671) for cervical precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Method(s): The histological cervical specimens of 396 cases including 93 CIN1, 99 CIN2, 93 CIN3 and 111 cervical cancers were tested for methylation-specific PCR assay (GynTect) of score and positive rate. Among them, 66 CIN1, 93 CIN2, 87 CIN3 and 72 cervical cancers were further used for paired analysis. A chi-square test was used to analyze the difference of methylation score and positive rate in cervical specimens. The paired t-test and paired chi-square test were for analyzing the methylation score and positive rate in paired CIN and cervical cancer cases. The specificity, sensitivity, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the GynTect assay for CIN2 or worse (CIN2 +) and CIN3 or worse (CIN3 +) were evaluated. Result(s): According to the chi-square test trend, hypermethylation increased with severity of the lesions as defined by histological grading (P = 0.000). The methylation score above 1.1 was more common in CIN2 + than in CIN1. The DNA methylation scores in the paired groups of CIN1, CIN3 and cervical cancer were significant differences (P = 0.033, 0.000 and 0.000, respectively), except for CIN2 (P = 0.171). While the positive rate of GynTect in each paired group had no difference (all P > 0.05). The positive rate of every methylation marker in the GynTect assay showed differences in four cervical lesion groups (all P < 0.05). The specificity of GynTect assay for detection of CIN2 + /CIN3 + were higher than high-risk human papillomavirus test. With CIN1 as a reference, the positive status of GynTect/ZNF671 were significantly higher in CIN2 + : odds ratio (OR) 5.271/OR 13.909, and in CIN3 + : OR 11.022/OR 39.150, (all P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The promoter methylation of six tumor suppressor genes is related to the severity of cervical lesions. The GynTect assay based on cervical specimens provides diagnostic values for detecting CIN2 + and CIN3 +.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The incidence of human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) tonsillar cancer has been sharply rising during the last decades. Myeloid cells represent an appropriate therapeutic target due to their proximity to virus-infected tumor cells, and their ability to orchestrate antigen-specific immunity, within the tonsil. However, the interrelationship of steady-state and inflammatory myeloid cell subsets, and their impact on patient survival remains unexplored. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to map the myeloid compartment in HPV+ tonsillar cancer. We observed an expansion of the myeloid compartment in HPV+ tonsillar cancer, accompanied by interferon-induced cellular responses both in dendritic cells (DCs) and monocyte-macrophages. Our analysis unveiled the existence of four DC lineages, two macrophage polarization processes, and their sequential maturation profiles. Within the DC lineages, we described a balance shift in the frequency of progenitor and mature cDC favoring the cDC1 lineage in detriment of cDC2s. Furthermore, we observed that all DC lineages apart from DC5s matured into a common activated DC transcriptional program involving upregulation of interferon-inducible genes. In turn, the monocyte-macrophage lineage was subjected to early monocyte polarization events, which give rise to either interferon-activated or CXCL-producing macrophages, the latter enriched in advanced tumor stages. We validated the existence of most of the single-cell RNA-seq clusters using 26-plex flow cytometry, and described a positive impact of cDC1 and interferon-activated DCs and macrophages on patient survival using gene signature scoring. The current study contributes to the understanding of myeloid ontogeny and dynamics in HPV-driven tonsillar cancer, and highlights myeloid biomarkers that can be used to assess patient prognosis.Copyright © 2023 Jimenez, Altunbulakli, Swoboda, Sobti, Askmyr, Ali, Greiff and Lindstedt.

AB  - Background: PAX1 methylation (PAX1m) and HPV viral load (VL) have been reported to detect cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), but the relationship between them is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between HPV VL and PAX1m and its effectiveness in predicting cervical lesions. (2) Methods: A total of 476 women referred to colposcopy for abnormal cervical screening at the Peking University People's Hospital between November 2020 and November 2021 were enrolled. PAX1m and HPV VL were determined by QMSP and BMRT-HPV reports type-specific VL/10,000 cells, respectively. (3) Results: PAX1m was significantly increased in HSIL, especially in cervical cancer, but there was no significant difference between cervical intraepithelial neoplasms 1(CIN1) and CIN2. However, HPV VL significantly differed between CIN1 and CIN2 but not between CIN3 and cervical cancer. In general, PAX1m positively correlated with all hrHPV VL, mainly in the HPV16/18 VL (p < 0.001), but had no relationship with the other 12 types of hrHPV VL. PAX1m had the highest specificity in diagnosing CIN2+, followed by HPV16/18 VL, which are higher than cytology >=ASCUS. (4) Conclusion(s): Hypermethylation of PAX1 is associated with high HPV VL, especially HPV16/18, and both present advantageous specificity in detecting CIN2+.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) are known to contribute to cervical cancer (CC), but the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in this process remains unclear, despite EBV's widespread detection in premalignant and malignant cervical tissues. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study of 258 cervical samples, including both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh cervical tissues, the presence and viral load of HR-HPVs (HPV-16 and HPV-18) and EBV were evaluated in Iranian women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and a cervicitis control group using real-time PCR. Result(s): The study revealed a significant correlation between disease severity and both increased HPV-16 positivity and HPV-16 and HPV-18 co-infection (p<0.001). Interestingly, the control group had a higher frequency of EBV-positive cases than SCC/CIN groups (p<0.001). HPV-16 DNA load increased with disease severity (P<0.001), while HPV-18 showed no significant difference (P=0.058). The control group had a higher EBV DNA load compared to SCC/CIN groups (P=0.033). HPV-16 increased the risk of CIN II, CIN III, and SCC, while HPV-18 increased the risk of CIN II and CIN III. Notably, EBV was associated with a lower risk of CIN groups and SCC. Conclusion(s): No significant difference in EBV co-infection with HPV-16/18 was found, failing to support the hypothesis that EBV is a cofactor in CC. However, high EBV viral load in the control group suggests a potential "hit and run hypothesis" role in CC progression. This hypothesis suggests that EBV may contribute briefly to the initiation of CC with an initial impact but then becomes less actively involved in its ongoing progression.Copyright © 2024 Sadeghi, Mostaghimi, Taheri, Yazdani, Javadian, Ranaee, Ghorbani, Bouzari and Sadeghi.

AB  - Background-Aim: Exploring the best triage test for women with cervical lesions is a timely area of research to advance cervical screening and management. The study aimed to investigate the diagnostic role of the HPV E6/E7 mRNA test for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2+) among gynecology complaints in northwest Ethiopia. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Compressive Specialized Hospital (FHCSH), between March 2019 and October 2021. Among women who visited the hospital for gynecological examination, those who were eligible for CC screening were included consecutively. A gynecologist collected cervical biopsies for histopathological examinations. Besides, cervical swabs were collected and tested for three HPV E6/E7 mRNAs (HPV16, 18 & 45) using RT-PCR, and HR-HPV DNA was tested using the Abbott Alinity m system following the manufacturer protocol at the Institute of Virology, Leipzig University Hospital, Germany. The diagnostic performance of the E6/E7 mRNA to detect CIN2+ was calculated using histology as a gold standard test. Result(s): We included 355 study participants (aged 30-80 years). The majority of cervical biopsies, 41.8 % (95 %CI: 36.6-47.1 %), were diagnosed as cervical carcinoma. The proportion of HR-HPV was 53.0 % (188/355; 95 %CI: 47.8-58.1 %). Likewise, the E6/E7 mRNA test was positive in 35.8 % (95 %CI: 30.0-40.9) cases. The detection of E6/E7 mRNA increased with the severity of cervical lesions (p-value < 0.05). The most predominant genotype that express E6/E7 mRNA was HPV16 at 108(85.0 %) followed by HPV18, 11(8.7 %). The sensitivity, specificity PPV & NPV of the mRNA assay for the detection of histologically confirmed CIN2+ was 65.2 %, 90 %, 85.8 %, & 73.6 %, respectively. Although the mRNA assay targets only three genotypes, the detection rate of the DNA was higher with an analytical sensitivity of 84.8 % but with a lower specificity of 74.1 %. Conclusion(s): The E6/E7 mRNA test meaningfully demonstrated better specificity and PPV in the detection of CIN2+. Cervical lesion progression can be marked easily by testing on these gene products. Hence, the mRNA test can be considered for colposcopy and histology triage. To optimize the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the E6/E7 mRNA test, large-scale studies that target important HR-HPVs should be considered.Copyright © 2024

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been established as a causative agent in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Specifically, HPV types 16 and 18 are known to be prevalent in oral cancers. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in OSCC cases in Qazvin province, Iran. Thirty-eight paraffin-embedded samples of OSCC were selected, and DNA extraction was performed using the Roche High Pure FFPE DNA isolation kit. The quality of the extracted DNA was assessed through PCR amplification of the human beta-Globin gene. The HPV detection was carried out using SYBR green-based real-time PCR with GP5+ and GP6+ primers targeting the L1 region of HPV. The HPV genotyping was conducted on positive samples using specific primers. Statistical analysis was performed between HPV infection in OSCC and age, sex, and anatomical location. This study analyzed 38 biopsy specimens obtained from male and female OSCC patients, with an average age of 64 years. Among these samples, 13 tested positive for HPV, resulting in a prevalence rate of 34.2%. The age group with the highest HPV infection rate was 61-70 (10.5%) years. Notably, HPV type 16 was detected in 21.0% of samples, HPV type 18 in 10.5%, and other viral subtypes in 2.6%. No statistically significant correlation was found between HPV prevalence and gender or age. The findings indicated that 34.2% of OSCC samples in the Qazvin province harbor HPV, with types 16 and 18 being the most common in tumors affecting the tongue. Additionally, no association was observed between HPV infection and age or gender. To address HPV as a risk factor for OSCC, public health initiatives such as vaccination, awareness campaigns, and accessible healthcare services should be implemented. They are, furthermore, incorporating HPV DNA testing into practice.Copyright © 2024 Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - The incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer in Croatia remains a health challenge despite screening efforts. Besides the persistent infection with HPV, the development of cancer is also associated with some cofactors. The goal of this study was to assess circulating HPV genotypes and risk factors for the development of cervical precancer after almost 16 years from the onset of HPV vaccination in Croatia. In this study, a total of 321 women attending gynecological care were evaluated. Relevant medical and demographic information, including cytology, were collected. HPV genotyping was performed by PCR. Comparing the HPV types found in circulation in the pre-vaccination (1999-2015) and post-vaccination periods (2020-2023), a statistically significant reduction in HPV 31 was noted, while the overall prevalence increased in the post-vaccination period. Besides the expected HPV positivity as a risk factor, the history of smoking was associated with LSIL or worse cytology at enrollment. For the first time, this population study revealed a statistically significant shift in the HPV genotype in the post-vaccination period, as well as the confirmation of risk factors for the development of abnormal cytology among Croatian women.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is associated with immunosuppression and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Response to standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT) varies considerably. A comprehensive molecular characterization of CRT resistance is lacking, and little is known about the interplay between tumor immune contexture, host immunity, and immunosuppressive and/or immune activating effects of CRT. Patients with localized ASCC, treated with CRT at three different sites of the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) were included. Patient cohorts for molecular analysis included baseline formalin fixed paraffin embedded biopsies for immunohistochemistry (n = 130), baseline RNA sequencing (n = 98), peripheral blood immune profiling (n = 47), and serum cytokine measurement (n = 35). Gene set enrichment analysis showed that pathways for IFNgamma, IFNalpha, inflammatory response, TNFalpha signaling via NF-kappaB, and EMT were significantly enriched in poor responders (all p < 0.001). Expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), both on mRNA and protein levels, was associated with reduced Freedom from locoregional failure (FFLF, p = 0.037) and freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM, p = 0.014). An increase of PD-L1 expression on CD4+ T-cells (p < 0.001) and an increase in HLA-DR expression on T-cells (p < 0.001) was observed in the peripheral blood after CRT. Elevated levels of regulatory T-cells and CXCL2 were associated with reduced FFLF (p = 0.0044 and p = 0.004, respectively). Inflammatory pathways in tissue in line with elevated levels of regulatory T-cells and CXCL2 in peripheral blood are associated with resistance to CRT. To counteract this resistance mechanism, the RADIANCE randomized phase-2 trial currently tests the addition of the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab to standard CRT in locally advanced ASCC.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - (1) Background: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precancerous condition linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, often necessitating surgical interventions carrying the risk of subsequent preterm births. This study explores the potential of imiquimod (IMQ), as a non-invasive alternative treatment. The focus is on understanding IMQ impact on immune checkpoint molecules, particularly PD-1, PD-L1, and sHLA-G, which play pivotal roles in shaping immune responses and cancer progression. (2) Methods: Forty-three patients diagnosed with a high-risk squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL, p16-positive) self-applied 5% IMQ encapsulated in sachets containing 250 g of cream into the vaginal cavity three times a week for 16 weeks. The impact of IMQ therapy on cervical lesion regression was assessed through immunohistochemistry (IHC), examining changes in sHLA-G, PD-L1, and PD-1 levels. The antiviral activity of IMQ was evaluated through HPV-E7 immunofluorescence. Ethical considerations were adhered to, and the research methods were based on a previously approved clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04859361). (3) Results: IMQ treatment demonstrated efficacy, leading to lesion regression. sHLA-G levels in CIN before starting IMQ application were associated with unsuccessful treatment (p = 0.0036). IMQ did not significantly alter the expression of PD-1. We observed a decrease in PD-L1 levels in those who were successfully treated (p = 0.0509) and a reduction in HPV burden. (4) Conclusion(s): IMQ exhibits promise as a non-invasive treatment for CIN, emphasising its potential to modulate the immune microenvironment. Baseline sHLA-G levels emerge as potential predictors of treatment response. Understanding the nuanced dynamics of immune checkpoints sheds light on IMQ mechanism of action. Further exploration is warranted to decipher the intricate mechanisms underlying IMQ treatment in the context of cervical lesions.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Early-stage (ES) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is diagnosed in about 30% of cases. The preferred treatment is surgery, but a significant proportion of patients experience recurrence. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy has a limited clinical benefit. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy have recently opened new therapeutic scenarios. However, only a few data are available about the ES-NSCLC molecular landscape and the impact of oncogene addiction on therapy definition. Here, we determined the prevalence of the main lung cancer driver alterations in a monocentric consecutive cohort. Molecular analysis was performed on 1122 cases, including 368 ES and 754 advanced NSCLC. The prevalence of actionable alterations was similar between early and advanced stages. ES-NSCLC was significantly enriched for MET exon-14 skipping alterations and presented a lower prevalence of BRAF p.(V600E) mutation. PD-L1 expression levels, evaluated according to actionable alterations, were higher in advanced than early tumors harboring EGFR, KRAS, MET alterations and gene fusions. Taken together, these results confirm the value of biomarker testing in ES-NSCLC. Although approved targeted therapies for ES-NSCLC are still limited, the identification of actionable alterations could improve patients' selection for immunotherapy, favoring the enrollment in clinical trials and allowing a faster treatment start at disease recurrence.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Several novel fluorinated chalcone derivatives were synthesized, and their in vitro anti-cervical cancer activity and mechanism of action were investigated using the parent nucleus of licorice chalcone as the lead compound backbone and MDM2-p53 as the target. Method(s): In this study, 16 novel chalcone derivatives (3a-3r) were designed and synthesized by molecular docking technology based on the licorice chalcone parent nucleus as the lead compound scaffold and the cancer apop-tosis regulatory target MDM2-p53. The structures of these compounds were confirmed by1 H-NMR,13 C-NMR, and HR-ESI-MS. The inhibitory effects of the compounds on the proliferation of three human cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, HeLa, and C-33A) and two normal cell lines (H8 and HaCaT) were determined by MTT assay, and the initialstructure-activity relationship was analyzed. Transwell and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effects of target compounds on the inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB) were used to detect the effects of candidate compounds on mRNA, p53, and Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein expres-sion. The binding characteristics of the target compounds to the MDM2 protein target in the p53-MDM2 pathway were evaluated by molecular docking technology. Result(s): The target compounds had considerable inhibitory activity on the proliferation of three cervical cancer cell lines. Among them, compound 3k (E)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-2-methyl-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) prop-2-en-1-one) showed the highest activity against HeLa cells (IC50=1.08 mumol/L), which was better than that of the lead compound Licochalcone B, and 3k showed lower toxicity to both normal cells. Compound 3k strongly inhibited the migration and invasion of HeLa cells and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, compound 3k upregulated the expression of p53 and BAX and downregulated the expression of MDM2, MDMX, and BCL2. Moreover, molecular docking results showed that compound 3k could effectively bind to the MDM2 protein (binding energy: -9.0 kcal/mol). These results suggest that the compounds may activate the p53 signaling pathway by inhibiting MDM2 protein, which prevents cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Conclusion(s): This study provides a new effective and low-toxicity drug candidate from licochalcone derivatives for treating cervical cancer.Copyright © 2024, Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Inflammation is an essential defense mechanism in which innate immune cells are coordinately activated on encounter of harmful stimuli, including pathogens, tissue injury, and toxic compounds and metabolites to neutralize and eliminate the instigator and initiate healing and regeneration. Properly terminated inflammation is vital to health, but uncontrolled runaway inflammation that becomes chronic begets a variety of inflammatory and metabolic diseases and increases cancer risk. Making damaged tissues behave as "wounds that do not heal" and sustaining the production of growth factors whose physiologic function is tissue healing, chronic inflammation accelerates cancer emergence from premalignant lesions. In 1863, Rudolf Virchow, a leading German pathologist, suggested a possible association between inflammation and tumor formation, but it took another 140 years to fully elucidate and appreciate the tumorigenic role of inflammation. Key findings outlined molecular events in the inflammatory cascade that promote cancer onset and progression and enabled a better appreciation of when and where inflammation should be inhibited. These efforts triggered ongoing research work to discover and develop inflammation-reducing chemopreventive strategies for decreasing cancer risk and incidence.Copyright ©2024 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Objective: Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. Oncogenic HPV subtypes play a very important role in the development of many cancers, especially cervical cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the importance of HPV subtypes in cervical lesions. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred seventeen women who were examined in the gynecological oncology outpatient clinic of the hospital, had a positive HPV test, and underwent colposcopic biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical and examination information of the patients were obtained from the hospital system and files. Result(s): Among the HPV subtypes in the patients, HPV subtype 16 was the most common. HPV subtype 16 was found most frequently in H-SIL and L-SIL lesions. In addition, cervical premalignant or malignant lesions were detected in 79 of 217 patients who underwent colposcopic cervical biopsy. Conclusion(s): Cervical cancer screening methods are one of the few screening methods that have been proven to reduce the mortality and incidence of invasive cancer. The most important risk factor in the etiology of cervical cancer is the HPV virus. As a result, we found that HPV subtype 16 was the most common, and HPV positivity decreased with age.Copyright © 2024 Kare Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and screening history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) or vaginal cancer and compare the sensitivity of cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) tests on the cervix against vaginal and cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or cancer. METHODS: This study included patients who underwent colposcopy-directed biopsy and were diagnosed with VaIN or vaginal cancer from February 2013 to November 2022. Clinical information was obtained from the medical records of the department. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) using t test, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: A total of 1,166 patients were included in this study. The median age of VaIN2+ patients was 50.5 years, whereas VaIN1 reported a median age of 42.1 years old, p < .001. This study reported that VaIN was significantly and positively correlated with cervical lesions (r = 0.244). The high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) detection rate was 88.2% (858/973) in VaIN and 95.2% in VaIN2+. Human papillomavirus 16 was the most prevalent HPV type in VaIN2+, which accounted for 54.9%, followed by HPV58 (19.5%), HPV52 (15.2%), HPV51 (12.2%), and HPV18 (11.0%). The sensitivity of hr-HPV and cytology tests on the cervix for detecting VaIN2+ was 94.7% and 83.4%, respectively. Both tests were not significantly different from detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+. CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus 16 is the dominant HPV type in vaginal precancer lesions. Cervical cancer screening has similar sensitivity for VaIN2+ as for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+, with hr-HPV testing showing higher sensitivity than cytology.

AB  - Background: Tumour hypoxia is a recognised cause of radiotherapy treatment resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Current positron emission tomography-based hypoxia imaging techniques are not routinely available in many centres. We investigated if an alternative technique called oxygen-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (OE-MRI) could be performed in HNSCC. Method(s): A volumetric OE-MRI protocol for dynamic T1 relaxation time mapping was implemented on 1.5-T clinical scanners. Participants were scanned breathing room air and during high-flow oxygen administration. Oxygen-induced changes in T1 times (DELTAT1) and R2* rates (DELTAR2*) were measured in malignant tissue and healthy organs. Unequal variance t-test was used. Patients were surveyed on their experience of the OE-MRI protocol. Result(s): Fifteen patients with HNSCC (median age 59 years, range 38 to 76) and 10 non-HNSCC subjects (median age 46.5 years, range 32 to 62) were scanned; the OE-MRI acquisition took less than 10 min and was well tolerated. Fifteen histologically confirmed primary tumours and 41 malignant nodal masses were identified. Median (range) of DELTAT1 times and hypoxic fraction estimates for primary tumours were -3.5% (-7.0 to -0.3%) and 30.7% (6.5 to 78.6%) respectively. Radiotherapy-responsive and radiotherapy-resistant primary tumours had mean estimated hypoxic fractions of 36.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.4 to 56.2%) and 59.0% (95% CI 44.6 to 73.3%), respectively (p = 0.111). Conclusion(s): We present a well-tolerated implementation of dynamic, volumetric OE-MRI of the head and neck region allowing discernment of differing oxygen responses within biopsy-confirmed HNSCC. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04724096. Registered on 26 January 2021. Relevance statement: MRI of tumour hypoxia in head and neck cancer using routine clinical equipment is feasible and well tolerated and allows estimates of tumour hypoxic fractions in less than ten minutes. Key points: * Oxygen-enhanced MRI (OE-MRI) can estimate tumour hypoxic fractions in ten-minute scanning. * OE-MRI may be incorporable into routine clinical tumour imaging. * OE-MRI has the potential to predict outcomes after radiotherapy treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a wart-like lesion mainly affecting the larynx, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 6 and 11. The disease affects both children and adults, and there is no cure. Surgery is the current symptom-relieving treatment; however, HPV vaccination is used as an adjuvant treatment. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims were to study effects of HPV vaccination in RRP cases and to compare juvenile-onset to adult-onset disease and high treatment frequency (TF) to low TF cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records of RRP patients were studied from May 2006 to January 2023. Eighty-five RRP cases, tested for HPV genotypes with PapilloCheck(R), were included. Vaccination- onset- and treatment analysis were performed. RESULTS: Twelve percent of the cases were vaccinated. The number of surgeries decreased from 2.0 to 0.8/year after HPV vaccination. Most cases had an adult-onset and less than one treatment per year. Juvenile-onset cases had a higher vaccination treatment ratio compared to adult-onset. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination was associated with a lower number of treatments per year, supporting the use of vaccination as an adjuvant treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Vaccination as adjuvant treatment to surgery may lead to increased quality of life for RRP patients and saved healthcare resources.

AB  - Metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) has only a 50% response rate to first-line combination chemotherapies and there are currently no targeted-therapy approaches. Therefore, we have an urgent need in advanced-PSCC treatment to find novel therapies. Approximately half of all PSCC cases are positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). Our objective was to generate HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to determine the biological differences between HPV+ and HPV- disease. We generated four HPV+ and three HPV- PSCC PDX animal models by directly implanting resected patient tumor tissue into immunocompromised mice. PDX tumor tissue was found to be similar to patient tumor tissue (donor tissue) by histology and short tandem repeat fingerprinting. DNA mutations were mostly preserved in PDX tissues and similar APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide) mutational fractions in donor tissue and PDX tissues were noted. A higher APOBEC mutational fraction was found in HPV+ versus HPV- PDX tissues (p = 0.044), and significant transcriptomic and proteomic expression differences based on HPV status included p16 (CDKN2A), RRM2, and CDC25C. These models will allow for the direct testing of targeted therapies in PSCC and determine their response in correlation to HPV status.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a major cause of cancer. While surgical intervention remains effective for a majority of HPV-caused cancers, the urgent need for medical treatments targeting HPV-infected cells persists. The pivotal early genes E6 and E7, which are under the control of the viral genome's long control region (LCR), play a crucial role in infection and HPV-induced oncogenesis, as well as immune evasion. In this study, proteomic analysis of endosomes uncovered the co-internalization of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, also called HER2/neu, with HPV16 particles from the plasma membrane. Although ErbB2 overexpression has been associated with cervical cancer, its influence on HPV infection stages was previously unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of ErbB2 in HPV infection, focusing on HPV16. Through siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition studies, we found that HPV16 entry is independent of ErbB2. Instead, our signal transduction and promoter assays unveiled a concentration- and activation-dependent regulatory role of ErbB2 on the HPV16 LCR by supporting viral promoter activity. We also found that ErbB2's nuclear localization signal was not essential for LCR activity, but rather the cellular ErbB2 protein level and activation status that were inhibited by tucatinib and CP-724714. These ErbB2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as ErbB2 depletion significantly influenced the downstream Akt and ERK signaling pathways and LCR activity. Experiments encompassing low-risk HPV11 and high-risk HPV18 LCRs uncovered, beyond HPV16, the importance of ErbB2 in the general regulation of the HPV early promoter. Expanding our investigation to directly assess the impact of ErbB2 on viral gene expression, quantitative analysis of E6 and E7 transcript levels in HPV16 and HPV18 transformed cell lines unveiled a noteworthy decrease in oncogene expression following ErbB2 depletion, concomitant with the downregulation of Akt and ERK signaling pathways. In light of these findings, we propose that ErbB2 holds promise as potential target for treating HPV infections and HPV-associated malignancies by silencing viral gene expression.Copyright © 2024 Mikulicic, Shamun, Massenberg, Franke, Freitag, Doring, Strunk, Tenzer, Lang and Florin.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The addition of p16/Ki-67 dual immunostaining to human papilloma virus (HPV) screening tests has been shown to increase the detection rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of p16/Ki67 dual staining in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2+) in women with high-risk HPV infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2017 and August 2019 at the Chulabhorn Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Women aged 20-70 years who underwent co-testing and tested positive for high-risk (HR) HPV (N = 215) were invited to participate in the study. P16/Ki67 testing was performed on residual cytological materials. Colposcopic biopsies were performed on all patients, and the results were correlated with positive or negative p16/Ki-67 test results. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of p16/Ki-67 dual staining in the detection of CIN2+ in the women with HR HPV infection were 74.4 % and 63.4 %, respectively. Compared with liquid-based cytology (LBC), p16/Ki67 cytology had similar sensitivity (p = 1.000) and specificity (p = 0.561) to LBC for detecting CIN2+. CONCLUSION: In this study, p16/Ki67 dual staining in HPV triage demonstrated a test performance similar to that of LBC.

AB  - A next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based Ezplex HPV NGS kit (SML Genetree, Seoul, Korea) was used for human papillomavirus (HPV) screening. Of 885 cervical swab samples, HPV was detected in 162 samples. High-risk HPVs were detected in 82 samples, and other types of HPV were detected in 13 samples (HPV86, 71, 102, 91, and 114). At the read depth >/= 500, NGS results exhibited 100 % agreement among repeated tests. HPV NGS results were compared with those of real-time PCR assays, Anyplex HPV28 (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) (n = 383) and Cobas HPV (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) (n = 64); concordances were 92.4 % and 95.0 %, respectively. Sanger sequencing of discordant results (n = 13) produced compatible results with those of HPV NGS. Pap smear abnormalities were detected in 31 patients (3.5 %), and 19 patients had high-risk HPV. Using HPV NGS for screening, rare HPV subtypes were detected, and quantitative values were obtained as read depth.

AB  - Advances in molecular tumor diagnostics have transformed cancer care. However, it remains unclear whether precision oncology has the same impact and transformative nature across all malignancies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related gynecologic malignancies who underwent comprehensive molecular profiling and subsequent discussion at the interdisciplinary Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) of the University Hospital, LMU Munich, between 11/2017 and 06/2022. We identified a total cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with cervical (CC), vaginal or vulvar cancer. Twenty-two patients (fraction: 0.71) harbored at least one mutation. Fifteen patients (0.48) had an actionable mutation and fourteen (0.45) received a recommendation for a targeted treatment within the MTB. One CC patient received a biomarker-guided treatment recommended by the MTB and achieved stable disease on the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for eight months. Factors leading to non-adherence to MTB recommendations in other patient cases included informed patient refusal, rapid deterioration, stable disease, or use of alternative targeted but biomarker-agnostic treatments such as antibody-drug conjugates or checkpoint inhibitors. Despite a remarkable rate of actionable mutations in HPV-related gynecologic malignancies at our institution, immediate implementation of biomarker-guided targeted treatment recommendations remained low, and access to targeted treatment options after MTB discussion remained a major challenge.

AB  - Despite substantial advancements in understanding the pathomechanisms of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), effective therapy remains challenging. The application of kinase inhibitors (KIs) in HNSCC, specifically mTOR and DNA-PK inhibitors, can increase radiosensitivity and therefore presents a promising strategy when used simultaneously with ionizing radiation (IR) in cancer treatment. Our study focused on the selective DNA-PK-inhibitor AZD7648; the selective mTOR-inhibitor Sapanisertib; and CC-115, a dual inhibitor targeting both mTOR and DNA-PK. The impact of these KIs on HNSCC and normal tissue cells was assessed using various analytical methods including cell death studies, cell cycle analysis, real-time microscopy, colony-forming assays and immunohistochemical staining for gammaH2AX and downstream mTOR protein p-S6. We detected a strong inhibition of IR-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, particularly in AZD7648-treated HNSCC, whereas normal tissue cells repaired DNA DSB more efficiently. Additionally, AZD7648 + IR treatment showed a synergistic decline in cell proliferation and clonogenicity, along with an elevated G2/M arrest and cell death in the majority of HNSCC cell lines. CC-115 + IR treatment led to an elevation in G2/M arrest, increased cell death, and a synergistic reduction in cell proliferation, though the effect was notably lower compared to the AZD7648 + IR- treated group. Sapanisertib led to a high cellular toxicity in both HNSCC and normal tissue cells, even in non-irradiated cells. Regarding cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis and necrosis, Sapanisertib + IR was beneficial only in HPV(+) HNSCC. Overall, this study highlights the potential of AZD7648 as a radiosensitizing agent in advanced-stage HPV-positive and negative HNSCC, offering a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the dual mTOR/DNA-PK-I CC-115 did not provide a distinct advantage over the use of selective KIs in our investigations, suggesting limited benefits for its application in KI + IR therapy. Notably, the selective mTOR-inhibitor Sapanisertib was only beneficial in HPV(+) HNSCC and should not be applied in HPV(-) cases.

AB  - Objective: Self-sampled human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a potential option for cervical cancer screening, but research is scarce in Cambodia. We evaluated the feasibility, accuracy, and acceptability of self-sampled HPV testing using careHPV. Method(s): A cross-sectional study including women aged 20-49 years attending 2 national hospitals in the capital city was conducted. Women underwent both self-sampling and clinician-sampling of specimens, and were then asked to complete an acceptability questionnaire. The paired samples were analyzed for high-risk HPV by careHPV and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Result(s): A total of 375 women were eligible for inclusion. Based on PCR, 78.9% were negative for HPV in both self and clinician-samples, 9.9% had a complete HPV type match, and 6.1% had all HPV types in clinician-samples also detected in self-samples. In 5.1%, one or more HPV types identified in the clinician-samples were missed in self-samples. When using careHPV, the overall agreement between the 2 sampling methods was 95.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]=95.8-95.6) with good concordance (kappa=0.66, 95% CI=0.56-0.76). Nearly 90% of the women preferred clinician-sampling over self-sampling, citing greater comfort, ease, and speed. Conclusion(s): Self-sampled HPV testing using careHPV could be an option for cervical cancer screening in Cambodia; however, it requires periodic quality control of handling procedures. In addition, women's health education regarding the accuracy of self-sampled HPV testing and the importance of follow-up in cases of positive results is needed.Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Background: We systematically evaluated benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of different cervical cancer screening strategies offering additionally Human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling (HPV-SS) to non-attendees. Method(s): A validated Markov model for the German context was used to evaluate additional HPV-SS for non-attendees age 25-65, 30-65 or 35-65 years, every five years with regular invitation, either Opt-in (invitation with link to order test), or Send-to-all (test sent with invitation) compared to standard CC screening alone. German clinical, epidemiological, economic data (indexed 2022/23), along with test accuracy and HPV-SS-attendance data from international meta-analyses and trials were incorporated. Outcomes included undiscounted life-years gained (LYG), and positive test results (PT) per 1000 women compared to standard screening without HPV-SS, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; in EUR/LYG). Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to check the robustness of findings. Result(s): Incremental undiscounted LYG (PT) per 1000 women (each compared to standard screening without HPV-SS) ranged between 0.90 LYG (28 PT) for offering with five-yearly screening invitation an HPV-SS (Opt-in) to non-attendees age 35-65 and 1.67 (62 PT) for HPV-SS (sendto- all) age 30-65 or age 25-65 years. Corresponding discounted ICERs (compared to next effective) for non-dominated HPV-SS screening strategies were 22,700 EUR/LYG for HPV-SS (Opt-in) age 35-65, 25,900 EUR/ LYG for HPV-SS (send-to-all) age 35-65, 726,000 EUR/LYG for HPV-SS (send-to-all) age 30-65, and 1.78 mio. EUR/LYG for HPV-SS (send-toall) age 25-65 years. Other Opt-in strategies were dominated. Results were robust over a wide range of parameter variations.

AB  - To systematically evaluate studies investigating the cost effectiveness of a possible implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling (HPV-SS) for cervical cancer screening. Relevant databases (including Medline (PubMed)) were searched (until 11/2023) for studies investigating the cost effectiveness of HPV-SS in cervical cancer screening in middle- and high-income countries in Europe. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Cohort studies, randomized controlled trials and decision-analytic modeling studies published in English or German were included. Key study characteristics (including author/year/country/currency/target population/study type) and outcomes (e.g., incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICER]) were extracted and reported into a standardized evidence table. The study quality was assessed using the CHEERS checklist. The original currency was converted to Euro (index year 2022) for cross-country comparison. Of 2,431 studies, eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. These included six model-based cost-effectiveness evaluations and five economic evaluations along trials and were primarily conducted in high-income countries. All studies compared HPV-SS with standard care (e.g., Pap smear/conventional cytology, clinician-collected HPV testing, standard reminder letters to get screened). Only few studies investigated HPV-SS in all screening-eligible women, most studies investigated HPV-SS in women not attending regular screening. Direct home mailing of the HPV-SS kit was the preferred method to reach women. ICERs were reported in nine studies and ranged from 2,900 EURO per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the provision of HPV-SS-based screening for non-participants (Netherlands) to 90,200 EURO/QALY (Sweden) for a combined strategy (cytology screening up to the age 35 years + HPV test with HPV-SS from age 35 years). All studies showed HPV-SS to increase screening participation. Screening with HPV-SS can be a cost-effective, practical, and feasible approach to increase screening coverage.

AB  - Background: While effective systemic therapies for penile cancer (PC) are still missing, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) as sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and enfortumab vedotin (EV), ADCs against Trop-2 and Nectin-4, showed high response rates in various tumor entities. Therefore we investigated the expression of Trop-2 and Nectin-4 in PC as possible therapeutic targets. Method(s): Clinical data and tissue samples from 203 patients with PC from Germany, Russia and Portugal were collected. TNM, histological subtype, grading and HPV-status were evaluated. Tissue micro arrays from the primary tumor and lymph node metastases were constructed. Nectin-4 and Trop-2 expression were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and classified by H-score (0-14 = negative; 15-99 = weak; 100-300 = moderate/high). Result(s): Moderate or high membranous Nectin-4 expression was found in in 28.0% of the primary tumor samples and in 18.8% of metastases. Expression in the primary tumor decreased significantly with increasing T-stage (p = <0.001) and did not correlate with HPV status (p = 0.788). It was also not associated with metastasis-free (p = 0.758), cancer-specific (p = 0.261) or overall survival (p = 0.345). Median H-score of Trop-2 was 270 and 300 in the primary tumor and metastases, respectively. 97.8% of primary tumors and 97.6% of metastases showed moderate or high Trop-2 expression. Discussion(s): Nectin-4 expression in PC is less common compared to other squamous cell carcinomas. Particularly advanced, more aggressive tumors showed lower expression. In contrast, Trop-2 is more commonly expressed in PC. Conclusion(s): EV therapy may be useful for selected patients with Nectin-4 positive tumors. As Trop-2 is highly expressed in almost all PCs, it seems a very interesting target for an ADC therapy with SG that has to be investigated in clinical trials. In parallel, preclinical studies are necessary to evaluate the rationale and biological effects of these new promising therapeutic options.

AB  - Background and purpose: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) describes tissue microvasculature and has prognostic and predictive potential in radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC). However, lack in standardization of DCE-MRI hinders comparison of studies and clinical implementation. This study investigated the accuracy and robustness of the population arterial input function (AIF), correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters and their association to T stage and human papillomavirus (HPV) status for HNC. Material(s) and Method(s): DCE-MRI was acquired for 44 HNC patients. Population AIFs were calculated with six different approaches. DCE-MRI was analysed in primary and lymph node tumours using Tofts model (TM) with population AIFs and individual AIFs, extended TM (ETM) with individual AIFs, Brix model (BM), and areas under the curve (AUCs). Intraclass correlation, concordance correlation, Pearson correlation and Whitney Mann U test helped examining the robustness and accuracy of population AIF, correlations between DCE-MRI parameters and their association to T stage and HPV status, respectively. Result(s): The population AIF was robust but differed from individual AIFs. There was significant correlation between Ktrans TM/ETM and ve, TM/ETM, and Ktrans TM/ETM and Kep, TM/ETM. ABrix and AUCs correlated for lymph nodes. Kep, Brix correlated with ABrix, Ktrans TM/ETM and Kep, TM/ETM for primary tumours. Kep, TM significantly decreased with increasing T stage. Both the correlations and the parameters' association to T stage were stronger for HPV negative lesions. Conclusion(s): Individual AIF was preferred for accurate pharmacokinetic modelling of DCE-MRI. DCE-MRI parameters and their correlations were affected by the lesion type, HPV status and T staging.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits considerable variability in patient outcome. It has been reported that SOX2 plays a role in proliferation, tumor growth, drug resistance, and metastasis in a variety of cancer types. Additionally, SOX9 has been implicated in immune tolerance and treatment failures. SOX2 and SOX9 induce treatment failure by a molecular mechanism that has not yet been elucidated. This study explores the inverse association of SOX2/SOX9 and their distinct expression in tumors, influencing the tumor microenvironment and radiotherapy responses. Through public RNA sequencing data, human biopsy samples, and knockdown cellular models, we explored the effects of inverted SOX2 and SOX9 expression. We found that patients expressing SOX2LowSOX9High showed decreased survival compared to SOX2HighSOX9Low. A survival analysis of patients stratified by radiotherapy and human papillomavirus brings additional clinical relevance. We identified a gene set signature comprising newly discovered candidate genes resulting from inverted SOX2/SOX9 expression. Moreover, the TGF-beta pathway emerges as a significant predicted contributor to the overexpression of these candidate genes. In vitro findings reveal that silencing SOX2 enhances tumor radioresistance, while SOX9 silencing enhances radiosensitivity. These discoveries lay the groundwork for further studies on the therapeutic potential of transcription factors in optimizing HNSCC treatment.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-35 accounts for up 10% of cervical cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa. We herein assessed the genetic diversity of HPV35 in HIV-negative women from Chad (identified as #CHAD) and HIV-infected men having sex with men (MSM) in the Central African Republic (CAR), identified as #CAR. Ten HPV35 DNA from self-collected genital secretions (n = 5) and anal margin samples (n = 5) obtained from women and MSM, respectively, were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Sequencing technology. All but one HPV35 strains belonged to the A2 sublineage, and only #CAR5 belonged to A1. HPV35 from #CAR had higher L1 variability compared to #CHAD (mean number of mutations: 16 versus 6). L1 of #CAR5 showed a significant variability (2.29%), suggesting a possible intratype divergence from HPV35H. Three (BC, DE, and EF) out of the 5 capsid loops domains remained totally conserved, while FG- and HI- loops of #CAR exhibited amino acid variations. #CAR5 also showed the highest LCR variability with a 16bp insertion at binding sites of the YY1. HPV35 from #CHAD exhibited the highest variability in E2 gene (P<0.05). E6 and E7 oncoproteins remained well conserved. There is a relative maintenance of a well conserved HPV35 A2 sublineage within heterosexual women in Chad and MSM with HIV in the Central African Republic.Copyright © 2024 Mboumba Bouassa et al.

AB  - An adult male Bell's hinge-back tortoise (Kinixys belliana) was admitted to a veterinary clinic due to a swelling in the oral cavity. Physical examination revealed an approximately 2.5 x 1.5 cm sized, irregularly shaped tissue mass with villiform projections extending from its surface located in the oropharyngeal cavity. An initial biopsy was performed, and the lesion was diagnosed as squamous papilloma. Swabs taken for virological examination tested negative with specific PCRs for papillomavirus and herpesvirus. Further analysis of the oropharyngeal mass via metagenomic sequencing revealed sequence reads corresponding to a member of the family Adintoviridae. The tissue mass was removed one week after the initial examination. The oral cavity remained unsuspicious in follow-up examinations performed after one, five and twenty weeks. However, a regrowth of the tissue was determined 23 months after the initial presentation. The resampled biopsy tested negative for sequence reads of Adintoviridae. Conclusively, this report presents the diagnostic testing and therapy of an oral cavity lesion of unknown origin. The significance of concurrent metagenomic determination of adintovirus sequence reads within the tissue lesion is discussed.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a primary oncogenic factor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) that elicits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although diabetic patients are more susceptible to various infectious diseases, the pathological association with virus-related NPC has not yet been clarified. Herein, we evaluated the influence of diabetes on the clinicopathological changes of 70 patients with NPC. Disease-specific survival (DSS) modified by viral infection was also analysed. The proportion of NPC patients with diabetes was 32.9% (23/70 cases), and 91.3% (21/23 cases) were infected with EBV detected by EBER-I in situ hybridisation. NPC with diabetes showed an effect on EMT evaluated by immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin, which was correlated with HbA1c levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined a HbA1c level of 6.5% as the cut-off value for primary disease death at 2 years [area under the curve (AUC) 0.76; sensitivity 0.64; and specificity 0.81]. High HbA1c levels (>=6.5%) significantly increased the number of lymph node metastases in NPC compared to low HbA1c levels (<6.5%, p<0.01). Diabetic NPC patients had a significantly poorer prognosis than all non-diabetic patients (DSS, 72 months vs not reached, p<0.05). Diabetic EBV-positive NPC patients had a significantly poorer prognosis than non-diabetic EBV-positive patients (DSS, 35 months vs not reached, p<0.01). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model also suggested that HbA1c >=6.5% was a significant factor in poor prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 6.84 (p<0.05). Collectively, our results revealed for the first time a high prevalence of EBV infection, poor prognosis and the importance of proper glycaemic control in diabetic NPC patients.Copyright © 2023 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia

AB  - Background. Renal transplant recipients have an increased cancer risk. The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor sirolimus (SRL) has immunosuppressive and antitumour activities but knowledge about its use in recipients with cancer is limited. Methods. We retrospectively analysed 726 renal allograft recipients converted to SRL from 10 German transplant centres. Patient and graft survival were analysed depending on malignancy status prior to conversion and tumour entity. Results. Malignancy before conversion to SRL was reported in 230 patients, with 137 patients having skin cancers and 101 having solid cancers. Cancer occurred 4.6 6 9.4 (median 3.0) years after transplantation. Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and Bowen's disease were the most prevalent skin cancers, while carcinomas of the kidney, colon and breast were the most prevalent solid cancers before conversion. Patients with prior malignancy were older and had better renal function at conversion compared with patients without a history of cancer. After conversion to SRL, cancer incidence rates (IRs) of all tumours were lower compared with rates before conversion. Cancer IRs after conversion were higher in patients with malignancy before conversion compared with those without. Patient survival was worse in patients with solid cancers compared with patients with skin cancers or without malignancies. Biopsy-proven acute rejections in the first year after conversion were less frequent in patients with malignancy compared with those without. Graft survival and renal function in all cancer types were better than in patients converted to SRL without cancers. Conclusions. Conversion to SRL in patients with a history of cancer is safe regarding renal function and graft survival, while patient survival is largely dependent on tumour entity.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose: The mechanism of methylation of HPV CpG sites in the occurrence and prognosis of cervical carcinogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the effects of demethylation of the CpG sites of E2 and E6, essential genes of HPV16 integration, on cervical cancer cell expression, integration, and proliferation. Material(s) and Method(s): HPV16-positive (Caski) cells were treated with different concentrations of the demethylation compound 5-aza-dc (0, 5, 10, 20 mumol/l) in vitro. After the intervention, the methylation statuses of HPV16 E2 and E6 were detected by TBS, the expression levels of E2 and E6 mRNA and protein were detected by real-time PCR and western blot, cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK8, and cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by FCM. GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2 and R version 4.2.3 were used for relevant data analyses. Result(s): The methylation levels of HPV16 E2 and E6 CpG sites decreased gradually with increasing 5-aza-dc intervention concentrations. With decreasing E2 and E6 methylation rates, E2 expression increased, the E2/E6 ratio increased, E6 expression decreased, and the growth inhibition rate of Caski cells increased. E2 and E6 expression were negatively and positively correlated with their degrees of methylation respectively, while the E2/E6 mRNA to protein ratio was negatively correlated with the methylation degrees of E2 and E6. Conclusion(s): Demethylation can be used as a prospective treatment to affect HPV expression and persistent infection, providing a new theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of viral infections.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).

AB  - Worldwide, cervical intraepithelial dysplasia common lesions in adult women, particularly after the age of 30 years. The high grade lesions are considered as premalignancy and could give raise to in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of uterian cervix. These cancerous transformations significantly can be reduced by screening program of the cervix, including: cytological examination of the cervix, HR-HPV test, and colposcopy. women with cervical cytology that showed morphology of intraepithelial dysplastic changes, especially high grade lesions, HR-HPV test should be done for these women. High prevalence of HPV infection will not predicate the risk of malignant transformation in these affected women, thus additional triage test, including immunochemical markers for transformed cells can be used to detect women need further evaluation, follow up and treatment.In current study, p16/Ki-67 dual biomarkers staining, were used for cytological smears to detect dysplastic cellular changes and can improve the diagnosis of pre-malignant lesions and squamous cells carcinoma. Aim of the study: To identify the role of p16/ki-67 dual immunostaining in predicting the presence of significant cervical lesions in women with mild cellular atypia. Patients and method: A prospective study of 214 women, with average age 38 years, over a period of January 2018 to December 2019, in Bagdad city. Women were referred from private gynecological clinics to private Al-Baraa lab and Lab of Dr. Inas Abd Al Majed Rasheed. All cervical cytological smears of the patients that were showed dysplastic changes, were submitted for HR-HPV-detection (by PCR), and p16/ki-67 dual biomarker of cytology followed by colposcopy-guided biopsy were done for 62 women.Copyright © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

AB  - Background Primary analyses of a study in young women aged 16-26 years showed efficacy of the nine-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV; HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) vaccine against infections and disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and non-inferior HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 antibody responses when compared with quadrivalent HPV (qHPV; HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine. We aimed to report efficacy of the 9vHPV vaccine for up to 6 years following first administration and antibody responses over 5 years. Methods We undertook this randomised, double-blind, efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study of the 9vHPV vaccine study at 105 study sites in 18 countries. Women aged 16-26 years old who were healthy, with no history of abnormal cervical cytology, no previous abnormal cervical biopsy results, and no more than four lifetime sexual partners were randomly assigned (1:1) by central randomisation and block sizes of 2 and 2 to receive three intramuscular injections over 6 months of 9vHPV or qHPV (control) vaccine. All participants, study investigators, and study site personnel, laboratory staff, members of the sponsor's study team, and members of the adjudication pathology panel were masked to vaccination groups. The primary outcomes were incidence of high-grade cervical disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, invasive cervical carcinoma), vulvar disease (vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3, vulvar cancer), and vaginal disease (vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3, vaginal cancer) related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 and non-inferiority (excluding a decrease of 1.5 times) of anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 geometric mean titres (GMT). Tissue samples were adjudicated for histopathology diagnosis and tested for HPV DNA. Serum antibody responses were assessed by competitive Luminex immunoassay. The primary evaluation of efficacy was a superiority analysis in the per-protocol efficacy population, supportive efficacy was analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, and the primary evaluation of immunogenicity was a non-inferiority analysis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00543543. Findings Between Sept 26, 2007, and Dec 18, 2009, we recruited and randomly assigned 14 215 participants to receive 9vHPV (n=7106) or qHPV (n=7109) vaccine. In the per-protocol population, the incidence of high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 was 0.5 cases per 10 000 person-years in the 9vHPV and 19.0 cases per 10 000 person-years in the qHPV groups, representing 97.4% efficacy (95% CI 85.0-99.9). HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs were non-inferior in the 9vHPV versus qHPV group from month 1 to 3 years after vaccination. No clinically meaningful differences in serious adverse events were noted between the study groups. 11 participants died during the study follow-up period (six in the 9vHPV vaccine group and five in the qHPV vaccine group); none of the deaths were considered vaccine-related. Interpretation The 9vHPV vaccine prevents infection, cytological abnormalities, high-grade lesions, and cervical procedures related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Both the 9vHPV vaccine and qHPV vaccine had a similar immunogenicity profile with respect to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Vaccine efficacy was sustained for up to 6 years. The 9vHPV vaccine could potentially provide broader coverage and prevent 90% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Funding Merck & Co, Inc.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: Aggressive laryngeal, tracheal, and pulmonary papilloma is an extremely challenging clinical problem without proven treatment options. A recent German report documented promising results with systemic bevacizumab. The objective of this study is to report the initial experience of this novel treatment in the United States for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Study Design: Cases series. Method(s): Electronic survey of the RRP Task Force of the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology, American Broncho-Esophagological Association, and physicians known to the authors to have used systemic bevacizumab for RRP. Result(s): Eleven completed surveys were obtained. In three cases, systemic bevacizumab was considered clinically but not administered. Eight patients were treated with systemic bevacizumab, all for aggressive papillomatosis uncontrolled by surgical and adjuvant therapy, including seven of eight with pulmonary disease. Treatment dosing ranged from 5 to 10 mg/kg every 2 to 4 weeks, with all patients responding (7/8 partial response, 1/8 complete response). In four patients who had postbevacizumab chest imaging, three demonstrated improvement of disease and one stabilization. Treatment interval could be lengthened in seven patients and clinical response maintained. One patient with long-standing pulmonary disease (>10 years) was diagnosed with malignant transformation while on treatment, and bevacizumab was discontinued in lieu of other chemotherapeutic agents. All other patients continue on systemic bevacizumab with minimal complications (hemoptysis n = 1, proteinuria n = 1). Conclusion(s): Systemic bevacizumab appears to have significant promise in the most treatment-resistant and aggressive forms of papillomatosis with a low complication profile. These results suggest bevacizumab should be studied in a formal clinical trial for RRP. Level of Evidence: 4.

AB  - This study describes a validation of the BD Onclarity HPV (Onclarity) assay using the international guidelines for HPV test requirements for cervical cancer screening of women 30 years old and older using Danish SurePath screening samples. The clinical specificity (0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88 to 0.91) and sensitivity (0.97, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.0) of the Onclarity assay were shown to be not inferior to the reference assay (specificity, 0.90 [95% CI = 0.88 to 0.92]; sensitivity, 0.98 [95% CI = 0.91 to 1.0]). The intralaboratory reproducibility of Onclarity was 97%, with a lower confidence bound of 96% (kappa value, 0.93). The interlaboratory agreement was 97%, with a lower confidence bound of 95% (kappa value, 0.92). The BD Onclarity HPV assay fulfills all the international guidelines for a new HPV test to be used in primarily screening. This is the first clinical validation of a new HPV assay using SurePath screening samples, and thus the Onclarity HPV assay is the first HPV assay to hold an international validation for both SurePath and ThinPrep.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the whole gene expression profiles and to ascertain potential biomarkers for 22 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) among Thai patients using the Illumina Human HT-12, V4.0 Expression BeadChip array. Result indicated 2,724 differential expressed genes composed of 1,560 up-regulated and 1,164 down-regulated genes (unpaired t-test, p-value <0.05; fold change >/=2.0 and </=2.0). The top 9 up-regulated genes were validated in 39 OSCC cases using TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Among these, the up-regulation of peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3) and keratin 17 (KRT17) genes was harbored in all 39 OSCC patients (100%). Likewise, statistical analysis indicated that gene expression in 8 selective genes including keratin 16 (KRT16), keratin 14 (KRT14), keratinocyte differentiation-associated protein (KRTDAP), keratin 6B (KRT6B), PI3, S100 calcium binding protein A7 (S100A7), stratifin (SFN) and keratin 5 (KRT5) was significantly associated with well differentiated OSCC (p-value <0.05). Moreover, high level of KRT17 protein was significantly associated with well differentiated OSCC compared to moderately OSCC (p-value = 0.041). Notably, using nested-PCR analysis indicated all OSCC cases in this study were HPV-free. Especially, KRTDAP, PI3, SFN mRNA expression were first reported among patients with OSCC. Conclusion, the whole transcript expression study and TaqMan real-time qRT-PCR assay were relevant regarding the increase in gene expression in OSCC. In addition, the up-regulation of PI3 and KRT17 might constitute potential candidate molecular biomarkers to diagnose patients with OSCC.

AB  - Inexpensive and easy-to-perform human papillomavirus (HPV) tests are needed for primary cervical cancer screening in lower-resource regions. In a convenience sample of 516 residual exfoliative cervical specimens from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California and U.S. National Cancer Institute Persistence and Progression Study, we assessed the agreement and clinical performance of a simple, inexpensive real-time PCR assay for the detection of 13 carcinogenic HPV types (the H13 assay; Hybribio, Hong Kong) that is marketed in limited-resource settings compared to previous testing by the Hybrid Capture 2 assay (HC2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and the Onclarity assay (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD). The test set was chosen to include many HPV-positive specimens. The reference standard was a combination of HC2 and Onclarity results for HPV detection and histologic diagnosis of controls (less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 [CIN2]) or cases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher [CIN2]) for disease status. In this enriched convenience sample, H13 tested positive for 94.4% of the 108 HC2-and Onclaritypositive CIN2 specimens and negative for 88.2% of the 51 HC2-and Onclaritynegative CIN2 specimens. H13 positivity was significantly lower than that of HC2 among women with CIN2 (89.9% versus 98.7%, respectively) (P 0.001) and CIN2 (53.5% versus 72.4%, respectively) (P 0.001). In conclusion, H13 corresponds well to the combination of HC2 and Onclarity and has good clinical accuracy compared to histologic diagnosis, with less cross-reactivity with untargeted HPV types than HC2. H13 is a lower-cost HPV DNA test that might be useful for primary screening in limited-resource settings.

AB  - Background: Age-adjusted evaluations have explored the possible utility of (HPV test results in women with LSIL Pap. We investigated HPV test results and histopathologic follow-up results of LSIL patients from China's largest CAP-certified laboratory. Method(s): Patients with LSIL between 2011 and 2015 from the Guangzhou Kingmed Diagnostics were retrospectively retrieved and their hrHPV test results and histological follow-up results were collected and analyzed. Result(s): LSIL result was identified in 37,895 cases from 2,206,588 Pap tests (1.7%) including 1,513,265 liquid-based cytology and 693,323 conventional Pap tests. The average of these women was 38.4 years (15-88). The LSIL reporting rate in women < 30 years was significantly higher than that in women > 30 years (2.1% vs 1.7%). The age specific reporting LSIL rates declined with increased age. 8,014 of 37,895 (21.2%) women with LSIL cytology also had HC2 HPV test results. 75.8% of women with LSIL Pap tests were hrHPV+ and the HPV+ rates declined with increased age except in patients older than 60 years. Overall histopathologic diagnoses within 6 months after LSIL were identified in 5,987 of 37,895 patients at Guangzhou Kingmed Diagnostics. CIN2/3 was identified in 15.2% patients, CIN1 in 66.9%, negative in 14.9% patients. No invasive carcinoma was found in all patients. Of 8014 patients with LSIL Pap test and HPV testing results, 1727 patients had histological follow-up within 6 months after Pap cytology test and HPV testing. The detection rate of CIN2/3 was significantly higher in patients with positive HPV testing result than that in patients with negative HPV testing result (17.8% vs. 8.1%). Among patients with LSIL/HPV negative tests, CIN2/3 was detected in 1 of 30 (3.3%) women aged 50 years and above, appearing lower than those in women less than 50 years (8.0%, 28/351, P=0.357). Conclusion(s): This is the largest histological follow-up study in women with LSIL Pap from China and the data are helpful in establishing a baseline for better understanding the status of cervical screening in China. The 85.1% positive predict value of LSIL Pap cytology for follow-up CIN lesion was within currently recognized benchmark ranges.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.

AB  - Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related death in females worldwide. Infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established risk factor for cancer development. However, genetic factors contributing to disease risk remain largely unknown. We report on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 375 German cervical cancer patients and 866 healthy controls, followed by a replication study comprising 658 patients with invasive cervical cancer, 1361 with cervical dysplasia and 841 healthy controls. Functional validation was performed for the top GWAS variant on chromosome 14q12 (rs225902, close to PRKD1). After bioinformatic annotation and in silico predictions, we performed transcript analysis in a cervical tissue series of 317 samples and demonstrate rs225902 as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for FOXG1 and two tightly co-regulated long non-coding RNAs at this genomic region, CTD-2251F13 (lnc-PRKD1-1) and CTD-2503I6 (lnc-FOXG1-6). We also show allele-specific effects of the 14q12 variants via luciferase assays. We propose a combined effect of genotype, HPV status and gene expression at this locus on cervical cancer progression. Taken together, this work uncovers a potential candidate locus with regulatory functions and contributes to the understanding of genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of our study was to assess the performance of different triage strategies for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-positive results utilizing either extended genotyping or a p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology (DS) approach, with or without partial genotyping. A subset of women with hrHPV infections participating in the Addressing the Need for Advanced HPV Diagnostics (ATHENA) study were analyzed to determine the number of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (>/=CIN3) cases detected, and the absolute risk for >/=CIN3 of each genotype. A clinical utility table was constructed to compare the impact of different triage strategies. In all, 2,339 women with single-genotype hrHPV infections were identified. Among these were 171 >/=CIN3 cases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved algorithm (HPV16/18 positive, or 12-other hrHPV positive and Pap positive, i.e., >/= atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) for primary HPV screening detected 132/171 (77.2%) >/=CIN3 cases and required 964 colposcopies (colposcopies per >/=CIN3 ratio: 7.3). An approach that uses DS instead of cytology in the FDA-approved algorithm detected 147/171 (86.0%) >/=CIN3 cases, requiring 1,012 colposcopies (ratio: 6.9). Utilizing DS for triage of all hrHPV-positive women identified 126/171 (73.7%) >/=CIN3 cases, requiring 640 colposcopies (ratio: 5.1). A strategy that detected HPV16/18/31/33/35+ captured 130/171 (76.0%) >/=CIN3 cases, requiring 1,025 colposcopies (ratio: 7.9). Inclusion of additional genotypes resulted in greater disease detection at the expense of higher colposcopy ratios. Substituting cytology with a DS triage approach improved disease detection and the colposcopy detection rate. Further reduction of colposcopy rates can be achieved by using DS without partial genotyping. Extended genotyping strategies can identify a comparable number of cases but requires an increased number of colposcopies.

AB  - Methylation biomarkers are promising tools for diagnosis and disease prevention. The S5 classifier is aimed at the prevention of cervical cancer by the early detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). S5 is based on pyrosequencing a promoter region of EPB41L3 and five late regions of HPV types 16, 18, 31, and 33 following bisulfite conversion of DNA. Good biomarkers should perform well in a variety of sample types such as exfoliated cells, fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials. Here, we tested the performance of S5 on 315 FFPE biopsies with paired exfoliated cervical samples using four different conversion kits (Epitect Bisulfite, Epitect Fast Bisulfite, EZ DNA Methylation, and EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning). The S5 values from FFPE biopsies for all kits were significantly correlated with those obtained from their paired exfoliated cells. For the EZ DNA Methylation kit, we observed an average increased methylation of 4.4% in FFPE. This was due to incomplete conversion of DNA (73% for FFPE vs. 95% for cells). The other kits had a DNA conversion rate in FFPE similar to the cells (95%-97%). S5 performed well at discriminating <CIN2 lesions from CIN2+ lesions on the FFPE with all kits given optimized adjustments to the cut-off. The area under the curve (AUC) for S5 on FFPE was not significantly different from the paired cells (0.74-0.79 vs. 0.81). The best sensitivity and specificity were obtained for EZ DNA Methylation after the adjustment of the cut-off to reflect its lower conversion rate. Consistent methylation results can be obtained from FFPE material regardless of the conversion kit used. The S5 classifier performed as well on FFPE material as on exfoliated cells with adjusted cut-off allowing easier clinical implementation.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia is a paradigmatic negative prognosticator of treatment resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The lack of robust and reliable hypoxia classifiers limits the adaptation of stratified therapies. We hypothesized that the tumor DNA methylation landscape might indicate epigenetic reprogramming induced by chronic intratumoral hypoxia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A DNA-methylome-based tumor hypoxia classifier (Hypoxia-M) was trained in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)-HNSCC cohort based on matched assignments using gene expression-based signatures of hypoxia (Hypoxia-GES). Hypoxia-M was validated in a multicenter DKTK-ROG trial consisting of human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative patients with HNSCC treated with primary radiochemotherapy (RCHT). RESULTS: Although hypoxia-GES failed to stratify patients in the DKTK-ROG, Hypoxia-M was independently prognostic for local recurrence (HR, 4.3; P = 0.001) and overall survival (HR, 2.34; P = 0.03) but not distant metastasis after RCHT in both cohorts. Hypoxia-M status was inversely associated with CD8 T-cell infiltration in both cohorts. Hypoxia-M was further prognostic in the TCGA-PanCancer cohort (HR, 1.83; P = 0.04), underscoring the breadth of this classifier for predicting tumor hypoxia status. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight an unexplored avenue for DNA methylation-based classifiers as biomarkers of tumoral hypoxia for identifying high-risk features in patients with HNSCC tumors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Development of malignancy is a pending threat for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Aim of this study was to analyze cervical dysplasia and infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) in patients with IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, single center cohort study in Germany. Consecutive IBD patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology were sent to Gynecology, where a questionnaire was answered and gynecological examinations including a smear for cytology and HPV were taken. Participants of a general screening program constituted controls. Descriptive statistics, 95% confidence intervals and odds ratios were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were recruited of which 99 patients participated. Analysis showed a significant (p = 0.05) difference between the prevalence of abnormal smears in patients with (22%) and without (6%) immunosuppressive therapy, while the latter had cervical abnormalities comparable with healthy controls (5%). All immunosuppressants showed similarly high risks for abnormal smear results. Only 11/99 (11%) patients had positive high-risk HPV tests, which is comparable with general population. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of abnormal cervical smears is higher in IBD patients compared to healthy individuals, but the difference is confined to patients with IBD and immunosuppressive therapy. Annual screening is advisable.

AB  - PURPOSE: Recent increases in incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States have been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, but empirical evidence is lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HPV status was determined for all 271 oropharyngeal cancers (1984-2004) collected by the three population-based cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Residual Tissue Repositories Program by using polymerase chain reaction and genotyping (Inno-LiPA), HPV16 viral load, and HPV16 mRNA expression. Trends in HPV prevalence across four calendar periods were estimated by using logistic regression. Observed HPV prevalence was reweighted to all oropharyngeal cancers within the cancer registries to account for nonrandom selection and to calculate incidence trends. Survival of HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients was compared by using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers significantly increased over calendar time regardless of HPV detection assay (P trend < .05). For example, HPV prevalence by Inno-LiPA increased from 16.3% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7% during 2000 to 2004. Median survival was significantly longer for HPV-positive than for HPV-negative patients (131 v 20 months; log-rank P < .001; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.46). Survival significantly increased across calendar periods for HPV-positive (P = .003) but not for HPV-negative patients (P = .18). Population-level incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers increased by 225% (95% CI, 208% to 242%) from 1988 to 2004 (from 0.8 per 100,000 to 2.6 per 100,000), and incidence for HPV-negative cancers declined by 50% (95% CI, 47% to 53%; from 2.0 per 100,000 to 1.0 per 100,000). If recent incidence trends continue, the annual number of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers is expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by the year 2020. CONCLUSION: Increases in the population-level incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States since 1984 are caused by HPV infection.

AB  - Japanese girls aged 12-16 years are offered free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening is conducted with cytology and not HPV testing from the age of 20 years. So far, no study has analyzed the effect of HPV vaccination against cervical precancers considering HPV infection status and sexual activity. We aimed to analyze the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against HPV infection and cytological abnormalities, adjusted for sexual activity. This study comprised women aged 20-26 years who underwent cervical screening in Niigata. We obtained HPV vaccination status from municipal records and a questionnaire along with information concerning sexual activity. Of 5194 women registered for this study, final analyses included 3167 women in the vaccinated group (2821 vaccinated women prior to sexual debut) and 1386 women in the unvaccinated group. HPV 16/18 (0.2% vs 3.5%), 31/45/52 (3.4% vs 6.6%), and 31/33/45/52/58 (5.0% vs 9.3%) positive rates were significantly lower in the vaccinated group (P < 0.001). No women vaccinated before sexual debut had HPV 16/18-related cytological abnormalities. VE for HPV 16/18 infection and high-grade cytological abnormalities in women vaccinated prior to sexual debut were 95.8% (95% CI 81.9-99.0%; P < 0.001) and 78.3% (95% CI 11.3-94.7%; P = 0.033), respectively, in multivariate analyses adjusted for age and number of sexual partners. However, analyses of all vaccinated women did not show significant effectiveness against cytological abnormalities. Our results showed the effectiveness of HPV vaccine against high-grade cervical cytological abnormalities and the importance of the vaccination before sexual debut.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The VACCINE [Vaccine Against Cervical Cancer Impact and Effectiveness] study evaluated the prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine-targeted human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) amongst young women of vaccine-eligible age. METHODS: Between October 2011 - June 2015, women aged 18-25 years from Victoria, Australia, were recruited through targeted advertising on the social networking website Facebook. Participants completed an online questionnaire and provided a self-collected vaginal swab for HPV DNA detection and genotyping (Linear Array HPV genotyping assay). Self-reported HPV vaccination details were verified with the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (NHVPR). RESULTS: Of 1223 who agreed to participate, 916 (74.9%) completed the survey and, for 1007 (82.3%) sexually-active participants, 744 (73.9%) returned the self-collected swab, of which 737 contained detectable DNA. 184/737 (25.0%) were positive for HPV. Vaccine-targeted HPV genotypes were detected in only 13 (1.7%) women: 11 HPV 16 (six vaccinated after sexual debut, five unvaccinated) and two HPV 6. Prevalence of any of HPV 31/33/45 collectively was 2.9%, varying significantly by vaccination status (fully 2.0%, unvaccinated 6.8%; p = 0.01). Vaccination rates among the sexually-active cohort were high, with 65.6%, 71.6% and 74.2% of participants having received three, at least two or at least one dose of vaccine, respectively. Of women self-reporting HPV vaccination, the NHVPR confirmed one or more doses were received in 90%. Strong associations were observed between vaccination status, age, language spoken at home and country of birth, as well as between HPV detection and the number of male sexual partners. CONCLUSION: Surveillance five to eight years' post-initiation of a national HPV vaccination program demonstrated a consistent and very low prevalence of vaccine-related HPV genotypes and some evidence of cross protection against related types amongst vaccine-eligible women from Victoria, Australia.

AB  - Therapeutic innovation for human papilloma virus-related (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) is impaired by inadequate preclinical models and the absence of accurate biomarkers. Our study establishes the first well-characterized panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids from HPV+ HNSCCs while determining fidelity of the models to the distinguishing genetic features of this cancer type. Despite low engraftment rates, whole exome sequencing showed that PDXs retain multiple distinguishing features of HPV+ HNSCC lost in existing cell lines, including PIK3CA mutations, TRAF3 deletion and the absence of EGFR amplifications. Engrafted HPV+ tumors frequently contained NOTCH1 mutations, thus providing new models for a negatively prognostic alteration in this disease. Genotype-phenotype associations in the models were then tested for prediction of tumor progression and survival in published clinical cohorts. Observation of high tumor mutational burdens (TMBs) in the faster-growing models facilitated identification of a novel association between TMB and local progression in both HPV+ and HPV- patients that was prognostic in HPV- cases. In addition, reduced E7 and p16(INK4A) levels found in a PDX from an outlier case with lethal outcome led to detection of similar profiles among recurrent HPV+ HNSCCs. Transcriptional data from the Cancer Genome Atlas was used to demonstrate that the lower E2F target gene expression predicted by reduced E7 levels has potential as a biomarker of disease recurrence risk. Our findings bridge a critical gap in preclinical models for HPV+ HNSCCs and simultaneously reveal novel potential applications of quantifying mutational burden and viral oncogene functions for biomarker development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary purpose was to evaluate the prognostic potential of diffusion imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in predicting distant metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) patients. The secondary aim was to examine differences in DWI and DCE-MRI-derived parameters on the basis of human papilloma virus (HPV) status, differentiation grade, and nodal stage of HNSCC. METHODS: Fifty-six patients underwent pretreatment DWI and DCE-MRI. Patients were divided into groups who subsequently did (n = 12) or did not develop distant metastases (n = 44). Median values of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume transfer constant (K(trans) ), and mean intracellular water-lifetime (tau(i) ) and volume were computed from metastatic lymph nodes and were compared between two groups. Prognostic utility of HPV status, differentiation grading, and nodal staging was also evaluated both in isolation or in combination with MRI parameters in distinguishing patients with and without distant metastases. Additionally, MRI parameters were compared between two groups based on dichotomous HPV status, differentiation grade, and nodal stage. RESULTS: Lower but not significantly different K(trans) (0.51 +/- 0.15 minute(-1) vs 0.60 +/- 0.05 minute(-1) ) and not significantly different tau(i) (0.13 +/- 0.03 second vs 0.19 +/- 0.02 second) were observed in patients who developed distant metastases than those who did not. Additionally, no significant differences in ADC or volume were found. tau(i,) was the best parameter in discriminating two groups with moderate sensitivity (67%) and specificity (61.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses did not improve the overall prognostic performance for combination of all variables. A trend toward higher tau(i) was observed in HPV-positive patients than those with HPV-negative patients. Also, a trend toward higher K(trans) was observed in poorly differentiated HNSCCs than those with moderately differentiated HNSCCs. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment DCE-MRI may be useful in predicting distant metastases in HNSCC.

AB  - Patients aged 80 years and older make up a fifth of patients with CLL but are underrepresented in clinical trials. We analyzed the outcomes of these patients treated with targeted agents in the front-line setting in six trials of the German CLL Study Group. Targeted agents included venetoclax, ibrutinib, and idelalisib, mainly used in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies. Among 716 patients, 33 matched the selection criteria (5%). Of those, the majority had relevant comorbidity, organ dysfunctions, and/or high-/very high-risk disease. The overall response rate was 73%. The median progression-free survival was 49.2 months compared with those not reached in younger patients. There were 11 documented deaths of which two were deemed related to therapy. Additional results including 40 patients treated with BTK-inhibitors from the GCLLSG registry suggest that treatment with targeted agents is feasible and effective. Dedicated studies are warranted for this particular subgroup of patients.

AB  - Cervical cancer stage-dependent therapies include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. Concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard therapy for locally advanced cervical carcinoma (FIGO>IIB), however therapy resistance in a subset of patients is still a major clinical challenge. The present study aimed to analyze the impact of Oncostatin M (OSM) stimulation on CCRT-induced cell death. The present study used cells derived from cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SW756, 808, CaSki and 879) and adenocarcinoma (HeLa). The cervical carcinoma cells were HPV18-positive (HeLa, SW756, 808) or HPV16-positive (CaSki, 879). In addition to the established cell lines HeLa, SW756 and CaSki, the more recently generated cervical cancer cells 808 and 879 were also used. To analyze their radiosensitivity, cells were treated with increasing doses of irradiation (0-8 Gy). To mimic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or CCRT in vitro, the cells were challenged with 0.975 mug/ml cisplatin, irradiated with 6 Gy or a combination. A total of 10 ng/ml OSM was applied for 2 h prior to the respective therapy. The responsiveness toward radiation alone varied among the cervical carcinoma cells. CaSki, 808 and 879 cells were resistant to irradiation up to 8 Gy. OSM pre-treatment sensitized two out of five cell lines (HeLa and 879) to irradiation. Notably, all tested cells were sensitized by OSM for CCRT-treatment, particularly in the less radiosensitive cells. Cell death enhancement was dependent on phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; Tyr705) signaling activation as demonstrated with a dominant-negative version of STAT3 interfering with phosphorylation at Tyr705 (dnSTAT3-Y705F). In conclusion, OSM pre-treatment was able to override resistance to CCRT via the STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types are the main etiological factors for cervical cancer. HPV16 and HPV18 are generally the most common forms associated with development of high-grade cervical lesions. This study was undertaken to identify intratypic variants of HPV16 and HPV18 among women with cervical lesions in Tunisia. Material(s) and Method(s): DNA was extracted from cervical samples collected from 49 women. using a PureLinkTM Genomic DNA mini Kit (Invitrogen). E6 and L1 open reading frames (ORF) were amplified by PCR and viral DNA amplicons were subjected to automated sequencing using Big Dye Terminators technology (Applied Biosystems). The obtained sequences were analyzed using an appropriate software program to allow phylogenetic trees to be generated. Result(s): HPV16 and HPV18 were detected in 15 and 5 cases, respectively. HPV16 E6 sequences clustered with the European German lineage (A2) whereas one isolate diverged differently in the L1 region and clustered with the African sub-lineage (B1). HPV 18 E6 sequences clustered with the European sub-lineage (A1) but L1 sequences clustered as a new clade which diverged from A1-A5. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the distribution of HPV16 and HPV18 sequences in women with cervical lesions in Tunisia is mainly related to European epidemiological conditions and point to the presence of recombinant HPV forms.Copyright Creative Commons Attribution License

AB  - Despite recent advances, the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains an area of high unmet medical need. HNSCC is frequently associated with either amplification or mutational changes in the PI3K pathway, making PI3K an attractive target particularly in cetuximab-resistant tumors. Here, we explored the antitumor activity of the selective, pan-class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib with predominant activity towards PI3Kalpha and delta in monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab using a mouse clinical trial set-up with 33 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with known HPV and PI3K mutational status and available data on cetuximab sensitivity. Treatment with copanlisib alone resulted in moderate antitumor activity with 12/33 PDX models showing either tumor stabilization or regression. Combination treatment with copanlisib and cetuximab was superior to either of the monotherapies alone in the majority of the models (21/33), and the effect was particularly pronounced in cetuximab-resistant tumors (14/16). While no correlation was observed between PI3K mutation status and response to either cetuximab or copanlisib, increased PI3K signaling activity evaluated through gene expression profiling showed a positive correlation with response to copanlisib. Together, these data support further investigation of PI3K inhibition in HNSCC and suggests gene expression patterns associated with PI3K signaling as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment responses.Copyright: © 2020 Klinghammer et al.

AB  - The LMNX genotyping kit HPV GP (LMNX) is based on the clinically validated GP5+/6+ PCR, with a genotyping readout as an alternative for the more established enzyme immunoassay (EIA) detection of 14 targeted high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types. LMNX is additionally provided with an internal control probe. Here, we present an analysis of the clinical performance of the LMNX using a sample panel and infrastructure provided by the international VALGENT (Validation of Genotyping Tests) project. This panel consisted of cervical specimens from approximately 1,000 women attending routine screening, "enriched" with 300 women with abnormal cytology. Cases were defined as women classified with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2+ (CIN2+) (n = 102) or CIN3+ (n = 55) within the previous 18 months. Controls were women who had normal cytology results over two subsequent screening rounds at a 3-year interval (n = 746). The GP5+/6+-PCR EIA (EIA) was used as a comparator assay and showed sensitivities of 94.1% and 98.2% for CIN2+ and CIN3+, respectively, with a clinical specificity of 92.4% among women aged >30 years. The LMNX demonstrated clinical sensitivities of 96.1% for CIN2+ and of 98.2% for CIN3+ and a clinical specificity of 92.6% for women aged >30 years. The LMNX and EIA were in high agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.969) for the detection of 14 hrHPVs in aggregate, and no significant difference was observed (McNemar's P = 0.629). The LMNX internal control detected 0.6% inadequate specimens. Based on our study results, we consider the LMNX, similarly to the EIA, useful for HPV-based cervical cancer screening.Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The rise in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has elicited significant interest in the role of high-risk HPV in tumorigenesis. Because patients with HPV-positive HNSCC have better prognoses than do their HPV-negative counterparts, current therapeutic strategies for HPV+ HNSCC are increasingly considered to be overly aggressive, highlighting a need for customized treatment guidelines for this cohort. Additional issues include the unmet need for a reliable screening strategy for HNSCC, as well as the ongoing assessment of the efficacy of prophylactic vaccines for the prevention of HPV infections in the head and neck regions. This review also outlines a number of emerging prospects for therapeutic vaccines, as well as for targeted, molecular-based therapies for HPV-associated head and neck cancers. Overall, the future for developing novel and effective therapeutic agents for HPV-associated head and neck tumors is promising; continued progress is critical in order to meet the challenges posed by the growing epidemic.Copyright © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Tumour necrosis family superfamily (TNFSF) member 15 (TNFSF15), encoded by TNFSF15, regulates immune responses and inflammation. However, the roles of TNFSF15 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs; formerly SNPs) in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) remain unclear. This case-control study included 2523 participants (1324 patients with OCSCC [52.5%] and 1199 healthy controls [47.5%]). The effects of TNFSF15 rs3810936, rs6478108 and rs6478109 on cancer development and prognosis were analysed by real-time PCR genotype assay. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were used to validate our findings. The results demonstrated that the patients with altered TNFSF15 SNVs had poorer histological differentiation than did those with wild-type alleles. TNFSF15 SNVs were significantly associated with moderate-to-poor histological differentiation in univariate logistic regression. In the GTEx database, the expression of altered TNFSF15 SNVs in whole blood was lower than that of wild-type alleles. However, the expression of altered SNVs in the upper aerodigestive mucosa was higher than that of wild-type alleles. In the TCGA database, the patients with higher TNFSF15 expression had shorter overall survival than did those with lower TNFSF15 expression, especially for human papillomavirus-negative and advanced staging groups. In conclusion, although TNFSF15 SNVs did not affect OCSCC development, the patients with altered TNFSF15 SNVs exhibited poorer histological differentiation. The patients with higher TNFSF15 expression had poorer prognosis than did those with lower TNFSF15 expression.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the colposcopic accuracy of the detection of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) according to the colposcopic terminology for the vagina from the 2011 International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy (IFCPC). METHODS: A total of 467 women who were suspected of having VaIN and underwent colposcopy at Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University from January to December 2018 were included in this retrospective cohort study. The 2011 IFCPC revised terminology for the vagina was applied, and the agreement between colposcopic diagnosis and vaginal biopsy pathology was analysed. RESULTS: Agreement between colposcopy and pathology was 69.16% (kappa=0.437, p<0.001), with 23.34% overestimated and 7.49% underestimated diagnosis for colposcopy. The agreement was the lowest (35.71%) in the high-grade VaIN group, which was significantly different from that of other lesion grade groups (p<0.01). Among grade 1 findings, thin acetowhite epithelium was the most frequent (80.51%). Grade 2 findings and vascular patterns were rare. The positive predictive values of the micropapillary pattern were 55.98% for low-grade VaIN and 5.98% for high-grade VaIN. The specificity of iodine negativity was 10.92% for low-grade VaIN and 8.30% for high-grade VaIN. There were significant differences in the maximum size of single lesions and in the number of lesions among different grade lesion groups. CONCLUSION: The agreement between colposcopy findings utilizing the 2011 IFCPC terminology and vaginal pathology is moderate, and more definite findings for high-grade VaIN may be needed. The micropapillary pattern can be considered an alternative low-grade finding, while iodine staining is nonspecific for all lesions. Scattered and spotty lesions suggest low-grade VaIN, while large single lesions suggest high-grade VaIN.

AB  - Almost all cervical cancer is associated with persistent infection of high-risk (hr) human papillomavirus (HPV) like HPV16. The E7 oncoprotein encoded by hrHPV plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. The present study aimed to establish a reliable protocol of immunohistochemistry stains to detect HPV16 E7 protein in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of various cervical lesions. Firstly, the HPV16 E7 gene was inserted into a prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T2. Then the recombinant plasmid pGEX-4T2-(HPV16-E7) was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The fusion protein containing a GST tag was purified, and New Zealand white rabbits were immunized to produce the HPV16 E7 polyclonal antibody. The anti-HPV16 E7 antibody was verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence stains, and applied in 182 HPV16 DNA-positive cervical tissue specimens and matched 36 HPV DNA-negative specimens by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, A positive correlation between HPV16 E7 protein expression and malignancy grade was observed. But there is no relationship between HPV16 E7 protein expression and tumor sizes, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, or lymphovascular space invasion in cervical cancer. These findings provide a basis for further research focusing on the role of HPV E7 protein in various HPV-related diseases.Copyright © The author(s).

AB  - Option recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) includes human papillomavirus (HPV) primary screening followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) triage. We implemented a program based on a 3T-approach (Test-Triage and Treat). Our objective was to verify the effectiveness of the program by defining a set of performance indices. A sensitization campaign was performed in Dschang (Cameroon) and women aged 30-49 years were invited to participate for screening based on the 3T-approach. Participants performed HPV self-sampling (Self-HPV), analyzed with the point-of-care Xpert HPV assay followed by VIA/VILI triage and treatment if required. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up were defined, and achievable targets were described for which the approach is likely to be running optimally. A total of 840 women with a mean age of 39.4+/-5.9 years participated. The KPIs included (i) the screening rate (8.4% at 7 months, target =20% at 12 months), (ii) HPV positivity rate (19.8%, expected range 18-25%), (iii) compliance to referral to VIA/VILI and complete test (100%, target >90%), (iv) compliance to referral to thermal ablation (100%, target >90%), (v) VIA/VILI positivity rate (50.6%, expected range 45-55%), (vi) a single visit from diagnostic to treatment (79.8%, target >80%), (vii) compliance to follow-up at 1 month (96.4%, target >80%) and (viii) at 6 months (70.6%, target >80%). Program performance based on the single-visit 3T-approach corresponded to defined targets and preliminary results support adequateness of KPIs for periodic monitoring.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Program ROSE (removing obstacles to cervical screening) is a primary HPV-based cervical screening program that incorporates self-sampling and digital technology, ensuring that women are linked to care. It was developed based on the principles of design thinking in the context of Malaysia. The program illustrates the importance of collaborative partnerships and addressing the multi-faceted barriers from policy changes, and infrastructure readiness to the implementation of a radically new cervical screening program in communities. The paradigm shift in cervical cancer requires a monumental and concerted effort in educating both the healthcare providers and the general public. In this short review, we highlight how Pilot Project ROSE incorporated evidence-based tools that rapidly scaled up to Program ROSE. These ideas and solutions can be adapted and adopted by other countries. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, it is incumbent on countries to pave the road towards the elimination of cervical cancer with pre-existing footpaths.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Cervical cancer screening has enabled a decrease in the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. Various screening modalities have been studied to date. In many countries, screening is still based on cervical cytology, where cervical cells obtained either on glass or in a liquid medium are examined under a microscope. However, the fact that the vast majority of cervical cancers are a result of persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (hr-HPV) has led to the implementation of primary HPV screening in many countries. Taking into consideration the fact that the majority of HPV infections are transient and do not cause cervical precancer, effective triage methods are needed to prevent an increase in colposcopy referrals. Among these, the most extensively investigated are HPV genotyping, HPV methylation, and p16/Ki67 dual staining. In this manuscript, we briefly summarize the current knowledge regarding different screening strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer, with a focus on p16/Ki67 dual staining. In addition, we provide an explanation regarding the rationale for the use of various screening modalities based on the molecular biology of cervical cancer and cervical precancerous lesions.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women all over the world. It is accepted that cervical cancer is highly related to the HPV. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 13 HPV types as group 1 carcinogens (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 66), which are commonly referred to as high risk-HPVs (hr-HPVs). Among these, hr-HPV-16 is undoubtedly the most carcinogenic based in the burden of cervical cancer (CC) and its precursor lesions. In our study, we analyzed retrospectively the data of a total of 2329 female patients who applied to the obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic of our hospital over a seven-year-period, whose cervical smear were carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytology. In this study, it was aimed to determine the data of of HPV prevalence in our region during the seven-year-period from April 2014 to April 2021 and the most common genotypes and to interpret them together with the cervical smears cytology and biopsy results if it is available. HPV 3, 6, 11, 16, 18, 21, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 70, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84 were identified by using linear array HPV genotyping test (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) from April 2014 to October 2017. HPV genotypes were identified by using HPV Genotypes 14 Real-TM Quant (Qiagen, Germany) between October 2017 and April 2021. This method detected HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 25.0) predictive analytics software. Continuous variables are indicated as mean +/- standard deviation, and discrete variables are indicated as number [percentage (%)]. Chi-square test is used to investigate dependencies between variables. All analyzes were evaluated to provide 95% confidence level and 80% test power. p<0.05 was accepted as significant for the analysis results. Out of 2329 patients, 1283 were found to be HPV negative (54.6%) and the others were found to be HPV positive (45.4%) by using real-time PCR in the cervical smears. It was detected that out of 1046 HPV positive patients, 585 of them (55.9%) had one HPV genotype and 461 of them (44.1%) had more than one HPV genotypes. As we divided all of the patients into two groups as <30 (Group I) ve > 30 (Group II) according to age range, HPV positivity was found 134/296 (45.2%) in Group I and 912/2033 (44.8%) in Group II. When we compared the HPV positive/negative results of Groups I and II by using chi-square test, no significant difference was found between the two age groups in terms of HPV positivity (p= 0.894). In our study, the most common HPV types were HPV 16 (14.2%), HPV 68 (8.2%), HPV 56 (8.2%), HPV 52 (7.1%), HPV 51 (6.8%), HPV 31 (6.5%), HPV 66(6.1%), HPV 39 (5.8%) and HPV 18 (5.6%) among the women with normal and abnormal cytology in the cervical smears. ASC-US was the most common abnormal epithelial cell change detected with HPV16 and 18 genotypes and it was detected 26.07% and 21.88% in patients, respectively. In our study, we found HPV prevalance in our region as 45.4% and the most common type was HPV 16. As a result, we concluded that it is important to determine regional HPV prevalance data, which is an important step in cervical cancer prevention strategies, and regional data of detected HPV genotypes.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have a broad range of clinical spectrum from subclinical or asymptomatic infection to anogenital carcinoma. The detection of HPV-DNA and determination of the risk groups in cervical cancer (CC) screening is very important because CC is considered to be a preventable illness which is the third most common cancer type of women in the world. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of HPV-DNA in women by two different molecular methods and to compare their results together with the results of cytology, in Eskisehir, Central Anatolia, Turkey. A total of 1081 women aged between 30-65 years, who applied to Eskisehir Early Diagnosis, Screening and Training of Cancer Center (KETEM) for screening were included in the study. Three separate cervical samples were collected simultaneously from the participants for cytologic examination and molecular studies. In the first step of the study, all cervical samples were investigated for the presence of HPV-DNA by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Germany) method. In the second part of the study, consensus real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) was performed in 152 samples which included HC2 positive and randomly selected negative samples, and then the HPV genotypes were detected by using a commercial kit based on pyrosequencing method (Diatech Pharmacogenetics S.R.L, Italy). In the first part of the study, HC2 test was found positive in 3% (32/1081) of the women, while in 4.4% (47/1081) Pap smear was positive alone or with HC2 test. Five (0.5%) samples yielded positive results with both of the methods, and four of them were positive for high risk HPV types. Cytology results were negative in 19 out of 23 (23/1081, 2.1%) samples that were reported as high risk HPV by HC2 test. On the other hand, 42 (42/1081, 3.9%) samples that were positive by cytology yielded negative results by HC2 test. In the second part of the study, 32 (21.1%) of 152 selected samples were positive by HC2 test, 40 (26.3%) were positive by Pap smear, and 53 (34.9%) were positive by consensus RT-PCR. All of the 32 samples that were positive by HC2 were also positive by RT-PCR, however 21 samples that were positive by RT-PCR were negative by HC2 test. Among 40 samples that were positive (abnormal) by Pap smear, HPV-DNA was positive in nine (22.5%) by RT-PCR and in five (12.5%) by HC2 test, but HPV-DNA was not detected in 31 (77.5%) samples by both of the tests. Genotyping of the strains could be performed in 44 samples, and the most common type detected was HPV type 16 (n=15, 34.1%), followed by type 90 (n=11, 25%) and type 18 (n= 4, 9.1%). In our study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of Pap smear method were estimated as 16.1%, 96%, 10.6% and 97.5%, respectively, based on the HC2 results which was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, a significant degree of concordance was detected between HC2 and concensus RT-PCR methods (Cohen's kappa: 0.665). In conclusion, regarding the insufficient number of cytopathologists in our country and according to the recommendations of American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) and FDA, it was once again demonstrated that, the implementation of molecular diagnostic methods in addition to the Pap smear for effective screening of CC are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to further developments in the diagnosis of glandular cervical changes with the definition of several new entities, the exact classification of these can only be achieved with the help of cytomorphology and additive methods. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of this work is to give an overview of the status and future perspectives of cytomorphological diagnostics and biomarkers in this setting. Our own expertise and literature data were considered and evaluated. We especially covered the benign group including microglandular hyperplasia, tubal metaplasia, and reactive withdrawal induced changes, as well as adenocarcinoma in situ of usual type and invasive adenocarcinoma of usual type. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Immunocytochemical markers may occasionally take a role in the evaluation of benign endocervical glandular proliferations, the mainstay of their interpretation occurs morphologically in the conventional routinely stained smears. Adenocarcinoma in situ of usual type has very characteristic cytological criteria, which are reproducible in daily work, and p16 positivity is a very useful marker for this HPV-related lesion. The present classification of invasive adenocarcinomas of the endocervix requires knowledge of new immunohistochemical and molecular technologies. Due to HPV vaccination we can expect a decrease of HPV associated adenocarcinomas and a relative increase of HPV negative, clinically more aggressive adenocarcinomas. The cytological features of some groups of non-HPV-associated adenocarcinomas are not specific. In these instances, the different biomarkers are more helpful.

AB  - At the beginning of 2017, the 8th edition of the TNM classification was presented. For oropharyngeal carcinoma, this was accompanied by a paradigm shift, as a separation of the classification depending on the association with human papillomavirus (HPV) status has been established. By considering the literature, this paper provides an overview of the characteristics of HPV-associated carcinomas, the new features of the TNM classification, and the existing points of discussion. The revision has improved the prognostic significance of the TNM classification; however, there are still tumor- and patient-dependent influencing factors that must be considered for future versions.

AB  - Update for Diagnosis and Management of HPV-Driven Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract. In the past decades, an increasing incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer could be observed. More than twenty years ago, a correlation between a pharyngeal Human papillomavirus high-risk type infection and the development of oropharyngeal cancer has been suspected. Especially younger patients without the former risk factors smoking and alcohol have a higher prevalence for this cancer type. HPV-associated cancer is developing in the lymphatic tissue of the tonsils and the base of the tongue. HPV-driven tumors can be defined as a clinical and morphologic distinct tumor entity with a significantly better prognosis compared to tumors based on smoking and alcohol consumption. They are demonstrating a clearly better treatment response irrespective of the treatment modality. The tumor development is assumed to be comparable to cervical cancer, probably through a step-wise process from dysplasia to invasive cancer. In the pharynx, no HPV-associated precursor lesions have been detected so far. Therefore, Screening program proven to be very successful in the cervix have not could not have been implemented so far. The reduction of HPV-associated tumor burden in the cervix is likely to be compensated by the rising number of HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer. P16 as a surrogate marker for HPV has been implemented in the 8th edition of the TNM classification for oropharyngeal cancer. A worldwide accepted definition of an HPV-driven tumor is lacking so far. P16 immunhistochemistry or HPV-DNA detection by PCR as single markers have an insufficient sensitivity and specificity. A combination of both markers demonstrates a higher accuracy compared to the gold standard RNA. Antibodies to HPV oncoproteins are reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers that could in the future possibly serve for early tumor detection.

AB  - Cytological examination for the early detection of cervical cancer (CCS) has been available in Germany since 1971. Women over the age of 20 are entitled to a Pap smear every year; however, thus far an organized screening program and personal invitations have been missing.The incidence rate of cervical carcinoma declined dramatically in the decades following the introduction of CCS, but the incidence rate has stagnated in recent years. The cause of cervical cancer is a persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV tests have been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CCS for several years. Furthermore, since 2006, the HPV vaccination has been offered as a form of primary prevention.As part of the German National Cancer Plan, the European Guideline for Cervical Cancer Screening was implemented and adopted into the 2013 Law on Cancer Screening and Registration. The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) was commissioned with the implementation of an organized cervical cancer screening program.In April 2018, the G‑BA published updated key points for the implementation of an organized nationwide screening program in Germany. While annual cytological screening for women between the ages of 20 and 34 will continue, women over the age of 34 years will be given a co-test comprising a Pap smear and an HPV test, every three years. Women between the ages of 20 and 60 will be contacted by their health insurance provider every five years and receive an information leaflet. After a test phase of at least six years, the new program will be evaluated.

AB  - Incidence of oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing significantly worldwide. Due to its association with chronic tobacco/alcohol consumption, but increasingly also with the human papillomavirus HPV-16, oropharyngeal carcinoma is a genetically heterogeneous tumor group with high prognostic diversification. HPV-associated OPSCC respond significantly better to previous treatment concepts than non-HPV-associated. Both after primary surgical as well as after radiotherapie, radiochemotherapie and anti-EGFR treatment, this tumor group shows a significantly better survival. There is no evidence that in HPV association only primary radiotherapy concepts should be used. Currently, in the 8th edition of the TNM classification (UICC, AJCC), the HPV-associated different prognostic consideration with a rearrangement of the tumor stages and the N status was taken into account. Regardless of the known blur, p16 status detection is the most practicable and least expensive method of detection today, and is therefore consistently recommended (also by the AJCC and UICC TNM committees). HPV16 positive non-smokers differ from HPV-16 negative smokers by nearly 50 % in 5-year survival. Transoral robot surgery (TORS), which is highly acclaimed in the US today, with the Da Vinci Telemanipulator (Intuitive Surgical) has triggered a downright euphoric discussion on the minimally invasive surgery of resectable OPSCC. Based on a stable data set, it is now clear that an R0 resection must be sought regardless of the surgical procedure. Resection margins < 5 mm (R0 < 5 mm) are considered to be an "intermediate risk" situation and, like the N status, influence the adjuvant concept (radiochemotherapy). During and after transoral surgical procedures, the risk of rebleeding should never be underestimated and can not be ruled out with the utmost care. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment management in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are of great clinical interest. OBJECTIVE: DNA methylation is an epigenetic process involved in gene regulation and could be a source of potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers. METHODS: This study comprises literature research in PubMed and own studies. RESULTS: Gene methylation, e.g. of PITX2, is a strong, human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent prognostic biomarker. SHOX2 and SEPT9 methylation in circulating cell-free DNA within blood plasma correlates with tumor stage and prognosis. Methylation of diverse immune checkpoints, e.g., PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4, is also prognostic and correlates with gene expression. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation is a source of efficient prognostic blood plasma- and tissue-based biomarkers. However, prior to clinical implementation, studies must prove that biomarker-guided treatment selection can lead to better outcomes or reduced toxicity. The applicability of DNA methylation as a predictive biomarker for targeted drug-based cancer therapy seems promising, although further validation is needed.

AB  - Importance of the Pap smear in the age of HPV testing Abstract. Screening for cervical cancer prevention is considered a success story. Since the introduction of the Pap test in the 1950s, the incidence and mortality of cervical carcinomas has decreased dramatically in the industrialized world. In developing countries, and especially in certain countries in Africa, cervical cancer is still one of the most common fatal cancers due to the lack of screening and therapeutic options. For decades, Pap tests and colposcopy were the basis of cervical cancer screening. In the early 1980s, it became known that almost without exception cervical carcinomas require infection with certain human papilloma viruses (HPV). Among other things, this finding also revolutionized cervical cancer screening. The quality of the Pap test is influenced by the conditions of collection and by the so-called interobserver variability. Overall, cytology shows a good specificity of 95 % with a lower sensitivity of 70 %. Additional immunohistochemical tests to determine the biomarkers p16 and Ki-67 can increase the sensitivity of the Pap test up to 94 % (analogous to the HPV test), which is why cytological tests are still considered very effective in countries with sufficient resources and expertise. In contrast, the HPV test is not subjective and has a high sensitivity of 94 %. However, the specificity is worse than for the Pap test, which is why HPV-based screening carries an increased risk of unnecessary clarification and therapy. The superiority of HPV versus cytological screening seems to be proven under defined study conditions, but only after the second or third screening round. If screening is performed opportunistically, as in Switzerland, there is a risk of so-called lost follow-up. It is precisely the failure to take advantage of screening examinations or their performance at irregular intervals that is considered the most significant risk factor for the development of cervical carcinoma. It should also be remembered that the HPV test only reflects the current viral shedding but does not provide any information about the time and duration of HPV infection. Further studies are necessary to determine long-term results and cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a common female cancer that could be diagnosed early with screening methods. Almost all cases are caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Therefore, detecting the presence of HPV DNA is important for early diagnosis and treatment. Regular determination of screening tests enables early detection of patients with the risk of cervical cancer. For this purpose, since August 2014 a new screening program has been carried out by Early Diagnosis, Screening and Training of Cancer Centers (KETEM). The aims of our study were to detect the HPV prevalence in Erzurum and determine the major HPV types under the scope of population based cervical cancer screening program. Female patients between the ages of 30-65 were included in the study. Pap-smear and HPV DNA samples were taken simultaneously. The samples were examined in a national central laboratory. The study was performed using conventional methods in pap-smear samples. Pap-smear samples from HPV (-) patients were not included in the pathological evaluation. Pathological results of the pap-smear samples, which were taken from the HPV (+) cases, were sent to KETEM by national central laboratory and then these results were used. Within the scope of this study, 52.000 women were screened. Among all these women 2.4% of the cases were HPV DNA positive. HPV DNA samples were screened by Hybrid capture 2 (Qiagen, Germany) method. The highest positivity was observed at age 40 with 65 cases (5.1%) and the lowest positivity was observed at age 65 with 2 cases (0.1%). 60.1% of the HPV positive cases were at 30-45 age group, 35.2% were at 45-60 age group and 4.6% were at 65 and above age group. The most common type was HPV 16 with the frequency of 12.2% and this was followed by HPV 31 with 7.4% and HPV 51 with 6.7%,HPV 52 with 4.4% and HPV 68 with 4.3% frequencies. The rate of the HPV 18, which is the type of HPV that carries high risk for causing cervical cancer, was 3.0%. 49.2% of the HPV positive cases had single and 50.8% of them contained more than one type of HPV. The most common pathological appearance was "low grade cervical intraepithelial lesion" (LGSIL) detected in 115 cases (9.2%) and "atypical squamous cells of unknown significance" (ASC-US) detected in 93 cases (7.4%). Cases that had abnormal cytology were referred to colposcopy. Consequently, it was concluded that regional screening is important in terms of the determination of the HPV type for the early diagnosis of cervical cancer and vaccination so prevalence studies should be increased and supported.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a major health concern worldwide. Cancer screenings for secondary prevention aim at reducing morbidity and mortality among women. Objective The guideline provides both an updated and an extended overview for the prevention of cervical cancer by screening and therapy. METHOD: The World Health Organization (WHO) developed this guideline in accordance with WHO standards. The respective executive summary was translated by a team of Austria's WHO Collaborating Centre. RESULTS: The updated and extended guideline contains 23 recommendations and seven good practice statements which address screening methods, test regimens, age groups, screening intervals and other topics. Target populations are adult females without known risk factors (general population) and women living with HIV. It is recommended that women from the general population undergo screening every five to ten years, starting at the age of 30. Women living with HIV are advised to get screened every three to five years, starting at the age of 25. Preferred primary screening tests are HPV DNA tests which may be supplemented with further tests in order to triage for further interventions. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - The incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer, the most common cancer in humans, continues to rise. The development of precancerous actinic keratoses and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is associated with infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) of genus beta (betaHPV). Persistent betaHPV infections in immunocompetent individuals are generally very well controlled by the immune system and largely asymptomatic. However, immunosuppression results in high levels of betaHPV in the skin and consequently increased viral oncoprotein activity, which in turn leads to a significantly increased risk for skin cancer. However, even in immunocompetent individuals, the risk of cSCC increases with age as a result of accumulated UV-induced DNA damage in the skin. In these patients, the mechanism of betaHPV-dependent carcinogenesis seems to be different from that observed in immunocompromised patients. The underlying mechanism of oncogenesis in immunocompetent patients is currently less well understood. This review summarizes the current research data, which provide compelling evidence that cutaneous papillomaviruses, particularly in interaction with UV light, promote skin carcinogenesis via a "hit-and-run" mechanism by enhancing the genotoxic effects of UV light in the initial phases of this multistep process. Furthermore, an overview of novel vaccination strategies against papillomaviruses that are currently tested in clinical trials is provided, which could significantly improve the treatment options for high-risk patients in the future.

AB  - In 2021, the 2015 German consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of uterine cervical carcinoma was updated. The present article summarises the new recommendations for pathologists: the incorporation of the International Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Classification (IECC), which morphologically separates HPV-associated and non-HPV-associated adenocarcinomas, as well as the reporting of the prognostic relevant growth pattern of the adenocarcinoma of the endocervical subtype (Silva pattern). Histologically, multifocality has been defined as the presence of clearly invasive foci with a minimum distance between each focus of 0.2cm. Because of its intratumoural heterogeneity, all carcinomas <=2cm in their largest dimension should be processed completely, and tumours >2cm should be processed with one block per centimetre of their greatest dimension. In cases of (radical) trachelectomy/hysterectomy, the distal vaginal resection margin and all parametrial tissue should be processed completely. Sentinel lymph nodes have to be processed completely by lamellation along its long axis in 0.2cm intervals. Immunohistochemical ultrastaging is mandatory. Staging should be performed using the 2009 FIGO classification and 2017 TNM classification. Reporting the revised 2018 FIGO classification is optional. To date, molecular markers have not been relevant for prognostication and treatment decision making. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - The majority of precancerous lesions of the lower female genital tract (intraepithelial neoplasia, IN) are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infections resulting in cellular atypia and in turn an altered tissue architecture. Depending on the pathogenesis, a distinction is made between vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) classified as classical VIN associated with high-risk HPV infections (u-VIN) and differentiated VIN (d-VIN), which is associated with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and p53 alterations. In the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification a novel grading system for squamous cell precancerous lesions of the lower female genital tract has been proposed, differentiating low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) including condyloma and HPV-associated alterations plus VIN 1, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 1) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) from high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (H-SIL) with VIN 2 and 3, VaIN 2 and 3 as well as CIN 2 and 3. The use of p16 immunohistochemistry can assist the differentiation. The new binary classification, however, contradicts the German cytological nomenclature (Munich nomenclature III), which differentiated three grades of dysplasia in order to avoid overtreatment of patients with moderate IN. The individual nomenclatures are compared to each other. It is recommended to report the grade of precancerous lesions in addition to the SIL classification of the WHO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule is a rare entity. In consequence disagreement in etiology, staging system and therapy of primary tumor with or without adjuvant treatment of regional lymph nodes are apparent. METHODS: Pubmed-Recherche of relevant literature concerning: lymphatic drainage, metastases, incidence, risk factors (leather, nickel, nicotine, human papillomavirus, Staging system (UICC, AJCC, Wang's system), therapy of the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies were found and analyzed. Results are inconsistent. CONCLUSION: The Wang-classification is recommended. Radiation and surgery are the treatment of choice for small lesions. Larger lesions (T3-Wang) should be treated with a combined approach. In cT1-cT2cN0-situation after accurate diagnostic, an elective therapy of regional lymph nodes is not necessary.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with a dismal prognosis. Besides tobacco and alcohol abuse, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an independent risk factor, particularly in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). One key determinant of therapy response and prognosis is the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). A strong anti-tumor immune response represents an important mechanism of tumor cell killing. Another major determinant is the tumor metabolism. One feature of tumor cells is their reliance on glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production despite sufficient oxygen supply.The presented studies were based on several different clinically and pathologically well annotated HNSCC cohorts. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on tissue microarrays and whole slides against p16, different immune cell markers, and metabolic markers. DNA and mRNA were extracted to detect HPV and assess immune-related and metabolic genes via RT-PCR and Nanostring.An initial assessment of HPV infection frequencies in different HNSCC cohorts showed that socioeconomic and regional factors strongly influence HPV prevalence. An analysis of the immunological and metabolic differences of HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC demonstrated an enhanced anti-tumor immune response together with increased levels of OXPHOS metabolism in HPV-positive OPSCC. In a subsequent study, a strong anti-tumor immune response together with an OXPHOS metabolism was associated with improved short-term survival in HNSCC. Finally, TIME differences of HNSCC primary tumors and recurrent tumors were analyzed to understand the poor therapeutic response of recurrences and discovered an overall decrease of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with significant loss of CD8-positive T cells and B lymphocytes as well as a significant decrease of tertiary lymphoid structures in recurrences after chemoradiation.These results demonstrate the clinical and molecular differences of HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC with a focus on OPSCC. Furthermore, they delineate the interdependencies of TIME and tumor metabolism in HNSCC in general and stress their impact on therapy response. Additionally, they show an impairment of anti-tumor immune response in recurrences after chemoradiation, which indicates immune evasion as one recurrence driver.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Etiologically, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) can be divided into OPSCC caused by noxious agents and human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven carcinoma. These types differ with regard to clinical features and prognosis-differences which are rooted in the underlying molecular biology of the tumor. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the molecular biological characteristics of the genetics, epigenetics, and immunology of OPSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review was performed on a selection of genetic, epigenetic, and immunological factors characterizing OPSCC. RESULTS: The understanding of genetic aberrations and their consequences for cancerogenesis and tumor biology is increasing. Epigenetic phenomena are complementing functional relationships. However, epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are complex and much research is still required in this field. Immunological aspects of cancer molecular biology have moved into the focus in light of recent advances in the field of immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: The tumor biology of OPSCC is primarily defined by its HPV status. Additionally, HPV-independent genetic, epigenetic, and immunological signatures are being defined. From these advances, rationales for new treatment concepts may evolve.

AB  - Limited health system capacities and competing health priorities in low and middle income countries (LMICs) necessitate a pragmatic approach to population-based cancer screening. Thus, the challenges faced by LMICs to implement a 'western' model of screening for common cancers and the possible means to overcome these challenges are presented. Breast cancer is the number one cancer with a rising trend in the majority of LMICs. Implementation of mass-scale mammography-based screening is not feasible and sustainable in most of them. While some LMICs have introduced breast cancer screening based on clinical breast examination (CBE), the programs need to be of appropriate quality. All LMICs should improve the capacity for early diagnosis of breast cancer along with other common cancers through community education, training of frontline health workers, facilitating prompt referrals and improving the infrastructure for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Resources permitting, the LMICs with high burden of cervical cancer may consider human papillomavirus (HPV) detection-based screening; a simple low-cost alternative is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Regardless of the choice, a strong linkage should be established between screening and treatment with implementation of robust quality assurance. The few LMICs with a rising trend of colorectal cancers and adequate resources may implement demonstration projects to screen with fecal immunochemical tests (FIT). Oral cancer screening of habitual tobacco and/or alcohol users using oral visual examination (OVE) may be implemented in countries with high burden of the cancer, but primary prevention (i.e., tobacco/alcohol cessation) should be prioritized. Screenings for other cancers are not recommended for LMICs.

AB  - The new WHO classification of tumors of the female genitalia entails some changes, especially those of prognostic and therapeutic relevance: there is a return to the term borderline tumor. Implants are again subdivided into noninvasive implants of the epithelial or desmoplastic type as before. Invasive extraovarian implants are classified as low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC). Former seromucinous carcinomas are now classified as endometrioid carcinomas (seromucinous subtype). New entities of ovarian carcinomas are mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated and dedifferentiated carcinoma, and mixed carcinoma. The classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms is analogous to that of pulmonary and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms, regardless of their location. Endometrioid endometrial carcinoma can be classified into four molecular subtypes, which have significant prognostic significance. New subtypes include mucinous carcinoma of the intestinal type and mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma. Stromasarcomas of the endometrium are further subclassified based on specific molecular alterations. Adenocarcinomas (ACs) and squamous cell carcinomas (PECs) of the lower female genital tract are distinguished from HPV-associated and HPV-independent carcinomas. Block-like staining for p16 is the accepted surrogate immunohistochemical marker. Grading has not been reported for PEC. For HPV-associated AC of the cervix uteri, prognostic assessment is based on the pattern of invasion (so-called Silva pattern). Serous carcinomas in the cervix uteri are endometrial carcinomas with cervical infiltration.

AB  - The standard of care in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has recently undergone some major shifts in prevention, diagnostics, staging, prognostication and therapy.Prevention: Subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) have been identified as causative agent for HPV-driven oropharyngeal carcinomas nearly two decades ago. Vaccination against HPV is now recommended for all girls and boys at the age of 9 to 14 years by the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO).Diagnostics: 18F-FDG PET/CT allows for a reduction of surgical procedures and is now reimbursed by the german health care system in certain indications. In N2/N3-disease after definitive chemoradiotherapy a FDG PET/CT is indicated to prevent neck dissection in PET negative patients. Moreover, a FDG PET CT is indicated in case of suspected recurrence of laryngeal carcinoma and as staging procedure in patients with cervical manifestation of CUP syndrome.Staging/prognostication: The favorable prognosis of HPV-driven oroparhyngeal carcinomas is now reflected by the 8(th) edition of the TNM classification. Therapeutic decisions should still be based on the established criteria of the 7(th) edition.Locally advanced disease: Treatment de-intensification strategies for HPV positive oropharyngeal carcinomas are currently evaluated. So far, the already published trials have reported a disadvantage for less intensive regimens. Therefore, de-intensification should not be practiced in current standard of care.Palliative systemic therapy: Checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the new standard of care after progression on platinum based therapies. In the Keynote-048 trial, treatment with either pembrolizumab alone (CPS > 1) or its combination with platin+ 5-flourouracil was superior to the current first line standard PFC.

AB  - Human papilloma viruses (HPV) are responsible for approximately half of all oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) and incidence rates of HPV-associated OPSCC continue to increase substantially. The defined viral carcinogenesis permits development of specific diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic approaches. Laboratory identification of HPV-associated OPSCC may be achieved by p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry combined with HPV DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using tumor tissue. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC have a relatively good prognosis; therefore, the HPV status plays an important role in patient guidance. Due to the relatively favorable prognosis, ongoing studies are evaluating whether less rigorous therapy for HPV-positive patients results in equally good cure rates. The criteria for patient selection are, however, still uncertain. Particularly markers for detection of HPV-positive patients with a high risk of treatment failure are lacking. Besides tumor stage and comorbidities, distinct genomic, epigenetic, and immunologic alterations are prognostically relevant for HPV-associated OPSCC, and might be of predictive value. Furthermore, the characteristic molecular alterations suggest the possibility of novel vigilant and specific therapy approaches. These may be inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is frequently activated in HPV-associated OPSCC, and immunotherapeutic methods, e. g., therapeutic vaccination. Although prophylactic HPV vaccinations may also prevent development of HPV-associated OPSCC, foreseeable effects on OPSCC incidence will be low, given the low vaccination rates in Germany. This highlights the fact that interdisciplinary research networks should enhance the necessary activities related to HPV-associated OPSCC.

AB  - The correlation between the cytological findings from the PAP smear and the histological outcome in cases where the cytological findings must be histologically verified, is an integral component of the German screening program for cervical cancer. These data are collected nationwide as part of a benchmarking process by the individual Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KV) in the federal states and reported to the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV) in Berlin. In most cases there is a good correlation between cytology and histology but in some cases either a different grade of severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is found or the histological findings are negative. The reasons for a lack of correlation can be insufficient sampling in the cytology or the biopsy or a misinterpretation of the individual findings. Although the findings from H&E sections are considered to be the gold standard in the histological evaluation, it has long been known that the interobserver agreement in these preparations is only moderate. A significant improvement becomes apparent, firstly by the classification of cervical cancer precursors into low-grade and high-grade groups and secondly by the targeted application of biomarkers, in particular p16 and Ki-67, according to the recommendations of the lower anogenital squamous terminology standardization (LAST) project. The biomarkers p16 and Ki-67 should be used in the differential diagnostics between reactive and reparative alterations and for further differentiation of a CIN grade 2 but not to confirm a CIN grade 3. It is still unclear whether p16 is suitable as a prognostic marker for low-grade lesions.

AB  - Since 1971 German women aged 20 years and older can annually participate in the gynecological cancer screening program free of charge. As part of this program a cervical smear is taken for testing. The Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, GBA) is planning to change this system so that women aged over 30 years can either choose to continue with annual cytological screening using a cervical smear or can primarily opt for a human papillomavirus (HPV) test every 5 years. Women who are HPV positive will receive a supplementary cytological examination as a triage method. In Germany classification of the cytological results is based on the third revision of the Munich nomenclature (Munchner Nomenklatur, MN III), which has been in operation since 1 January 2015. The number of accredited cytology institutions and of cytologists has changed considerably since 2008. There has been a marked increase in the number of pathologists by 28.4%, which is a promising trend. The number of tests carried out has remained relatively constant; however, an increasing number of tests are now being performed in large laboratories.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the long-term HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine immunogenicity persistence in women. DESIGN: Multicentre, open-label, long-term follow-up (NCT00947115) of a primary phase-III study (NCT00196937). SETTING: Six centres in Germany and Poland. POPULATION: 488 healthy women (aged 15-55 years, age-stratified into groups: 15-25, 26-45, and 46-55 years) who received three vaccine doses in the primary study. METHODS: Immune responses were evaluated in serum and cervicovaginal secretion (CVS) samples 6 years after dose 1. Anti-HPV-16/18 geometric mean titres (GMTs) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and were used to fit the modified power-law and piecewise models, predicting long-term immunogenicity. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-HPV-16/18 seropositivity rates and GMTs 6 years after dose 1. RESULTS: At 6 years after dose 1, all women were seropositive for anti-HPV-16 and >/=97% were seropositive for anti-HPV-18 antibodies. GMTs ranged from 277.7 to 1344.6 EU/ml, and from 97.6 to 438.2 EU/ml, for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18, respectively. In all age groups, GMTs were higher (anti-HPV-16, 9.3-45.1-fold; anti-HPV-18, 4.3-19.4-fold) than levels associated with natural infection (29.8 EU/ml). A strong correlation between serum and CVS anti-HPV-16/18 levels was observed, with correlation coefficients of 0.81-0.96 (anti-HPV-16) and 0.69-0.84 (anti-HPV-18). Exploratory modelling based on the 6-year data predicted vaccine-induced anti-HPV-16/18 levels above natural infection levels for at least 20 years, except for anti-HPV-18 in the older age group (piecewise model). One vaccine-related and two fatal SAEs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: At 6 years after vaccination, immune responses induced by the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine were sustained in all age groups.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women worldwide, with an estimated 529,000 new cases in 2008. The incidence of cervical cancer in Germany is still among the highest in Western Europe. For more than 40 years women in Germany have had legal and free access to a conventional cytologic smear test starting at the age of 20 years. The introduction of the Pap smear subsequently led to a reduction in the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. However, the low sensitivity of the Pap smear and the evidence regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) in the context of cervical cancer have led to a critical view of the existing early detection of cervical cancer. In the meantime, new screening methods have been developed and different HPV tests, liquid-based cytology, and novel biomarkers have become available. Several randomized studies have investigated HPV testing as a primary cervical cancer screening test, generating a large body of evidence. It is expected that a combination of HPV testing and cytology will improve cervical cancer screening. In the near future, the early detection of cervical cancer in Germany will be restructured on the basis of the German National Cancer Plan as well as the new Cancer Screening and Registers Act (KFRG). The European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening will be taken into account, and an organized, population-based, and quality-assured cervical cancer screening program will be implemented.

AB  - Currently, the human papilloma virus (HPV), in addition to tobacco and alcohol, is considered another independent risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous head and neck cancer (OPSCC), where the prevalence of HPV-16 increases to 50-90 % for the oropharynx. Also, incidence and mortality in head and neck SCC (HNSCC) continue to be higher in African Americans (AA) than in Caucasian Americans (CA). A recent study found that poorer survival outcomes for AA versus CA with oropharyngeal tumors were attributable to racial differences in the prevalence of HPV positive (+) tumors; HPV negative (-) AA and CA patients had similar outcomes (Settle et al., Cancer Prev Res (Phila) 2:776-781, 2009). Evidence indicates that a HPV+ diagnosis has significant prognostic implications; these patients have at least half the risk of death when compared with the HPV- patient, due in part to a better response to chemoradiotherapy (Fakhry et al., J Natl Cancer Inst 100:261-269, 2008).Epigenetic events of promoter hypermethylation are emerging as promising molecular strategies for cancer detection, representing tumor-specific markers occurring early in tumor progression. HPV infection is now recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of OPSCC, where HPV+ and HPV- patients appear to be clinically and biologically distinct with reported genome-wide hypomethylation and promoter hypermethylation in HPV+ HNSCC tumors. A recent study from our group applying pathway analysis to investigate the biological role of the differentially methylated genes in HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC reported 8 signal transduction pathways germane to HNSCC (Worsham et al., Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 149:409-416, 2013).

AB  - The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is steadily increasing worldwide and has already exceeded cervical cancer rates in the USA. Due to their tumor biology, HPV-positive tumors of the oropharynx, which have been included in the eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC (American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union Internationale Contre le Cancer) Staging Manual since 2018, represent a separate entity. Following biopsy, diagnostic confirmation is performed by immunohistochemical detection of p16 expression, with p16 acting as a surrogate marker. Therapeutically, surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches are considered equivalent in terms of efficacy. With a 5-year overall survival of up to 80%, patients with HPV-positive OPSCC have a better prognosis compared to patients with HPV-negative OPSCC, where survival rates are between 40 and 50%.

AB  - PURPOSE: Forkhead Box Protein 3 (FoxP3) is known as a key mediator in the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The aim of our study was to investigate whether FoxP3-positive Tregs have the potential to act as an independent predictor in progression as well as in regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, especially in patients with intermediate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II). METHODS: Nuclear FoxP3 expression was immunohistochemically analysed in 169 patient samples (CIN I, CIN II with regressive course, CIN II with progressive course, CIN III). The median numbers were calculated for each slide and correlated with the histological CIN grade. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 26 (Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rank correlation). RESULTS: An increased FoxP3 expression in CIN II with progression could be detected in comparison to CIN II with regression (p = 0.003). Total FoxP3 expression (epithelium and dysplasia-connected stroma) was higher in more advanced CIN grades (p < 0.001 for CIN I vs. CIN II; p = 0.227 for CIN II vs. CIN III). A positive correlation could be detected between FoxP3-positive cells in epithelium and total FoxP3 expression (Spearman's Rho: 0,565; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Expression of FoxP3 could be a helpful predictive factor to assess the risks of CIN II progression. As a prognosticator for regression and progression in cervical intraepithelial lesions it might thereby help in the decision process regarding surgical treatment vs. watchful waiting strategy to prevent conisation-associated risks for patients in child-bearing age. In addition, the findings support the potential of Tregs as a target for immune therapy in cervical cancer patients. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established etiologic factor for cancers in the head and neck region, specifically for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC). The comparatively good overall survival justifies the current discussion regarding therapy de-escalation for patients with a low-risk profile. In addition to the immunohistochemistry-based biomarker p16INK4a, there is still a need for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that allow risk stratification and monitoring during therapy and follow-up of these patients. In recent years, liquid biopsy, especially in the form of plasma samples, has gained importance and is already used to monitor viral DNA in patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Circulating DNA (ctDNA) released by the tumor into the bloodstream is particularly suitable for a high specificity in detecting virus-associated tumors. Detection of viral E6 and E7 oncogenes in HPV-positive OPSCC is predominantly performed by droplet digital/quantitative PCR as well as next generation sequencing. Detection of circulating HPV-DNA derived from tumor cells (ctHPV-DNA) at diagnosis is associated with advanced tumor stage, locoregional and distant metastases. Longitudinal studies have further demonstrated that detectable and/or increasing ctHPV-DNA levels are associated with treatment failure and disease relapse. However, a standardization of the diagnostic procedure is necessary before introducing liquid biopsy into the clinical routine. In the future, this might allow a valid reflection of disease progression in HPV-positive OPSCC.
