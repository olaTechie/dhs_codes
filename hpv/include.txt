AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) induce condylomata, anogenital cancers and their precursor lesions as anal or penile intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN/PIN). HIV-positive individuals have an increased risk for the development of anogenital HPV-induced lesions. OBJECTIVE: Estimation of the prevalence of HPV-related anogenital benign and malignant lesions in HIV-infected men attending a screening programme. METHODS: Four hundred HIV-positive men [98% men who have sex with men (MSM)] were enrolled in this prospective study from 2008 to 2011. All patients received an inspection of the anogenital region, digital rectal examination, high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), anal cytology, anal/penile histology if required, and HPV-typing of anal and penile swabs. RESULTS: At baseline, 75% (n = 302) of the men had abnormal anal cytological/histological results. 41% presented with low-grade (n = 164), 24% with high-grade anal dysplasia (n = 95) and two men with invasive anal cancer. 2.3% had PIN (n = 9) and one patient had penile cancer at baseline. Throughout the study period, 75% had anal dysplasia (low-grade n = 177, high-grade n = 125), 3.3% (n = 13) had PIN and two further patients developed anal cancer. Within the study period, 52.8% (n = 211) had condylomata (49% anal, 15% penile, 11% anal plus penile condylomata). At baseline, 88.5% of anal and 39.3% of penile swabs were HPV-DNA positive, and 77.8% of anal and 26.5% of penile swabs carried high-risk HPV-types. HPV16 was the most frequent HPV-type. CONCLUSION: HIV-positive MSM have a high risk for HPV-induced condylomata, (pre)malignant anogenital lesions and anogenital cancers. Screening for HPV-induced dysplasia is crucial to avoid progression to invasive carcinomas. Additionally, HPV-vaccination recommendations should be extended to high-risk populations.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess risk factors of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in the Munich area of Southern Germany in relation to human papillomavirus (HPV) association of the tumors. To demonstrate differences in tumor characteristics and their impact on adjuvant treatment. METHODS: Between November 2010 and July 2013, patients were prospectively interviewed for risk factors before they underwent surgical resection of their tumors. HPV association was evaluated by p16 immunohistochemistry; tumor characteristics and type of adjuvant treatment were recorded. Follow-up data were collected after a median follow-up of 12.1 month. RESULTS: In contrast to many recent studies, we could not detect any difference in overall age and age at sexual debut between p16-positive and p16-negative patients. P16-negative patients are characterized by a more intensive tobacco and alcohol use, a more abusive way of consumption, less nonoral and less oral sex partners. P16-positive patients had a significantly higher risk of lymph node metastases, but nevertheless a significant lower risk to recur or to die. No difference in the incidence of synchronous second primary tumors was seen. P16-positive patients generally received a more aggressive adjuvant treatment because of more frequently involved lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, drinking, and sexual habits were independent from age, but showed marked differences between the p16-positive and p16-negative group. Since p16-positive patients were treated more aggressively, it is not possible to distinguish whether the better outcome of HPV-positive patients is a result of less aggressive cancers or more aggressive treatment. With regard to the ongoing debate about treatment deintensification, we should keep in mind that the survival of HPV-positive cancer patients is not 100 %.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials showed human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening leads to a significant reduction in cervical cancer incidence compared with cytology-based screening only. METHODS: Non-hysterectomised participants >/=30 years underwent co-testing with Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and HR-HPV testing (Hybrid Capture 2; HC2). Women with normal findings had their next screening round after 5 years, and HC2+ and Pap abnormal cases were immediately referred for colposcopy, while cases with discordant findings had repeat testing after 12 months with referral to colposcopy in cases with persistent positive findings. RESULTS: Twenty-six thousand six hundred and twenty-four women were recruited between February 2006 and December 2016. Two hundred and seventy-four CIN3+ cases were diagnosed (270 HPV+, 4 HPV-), including 31 invasive cervical cancers (29 HPV+, 2 HPV-). No CIN3+ was detected in HPV- women with abnormal cytology. We observed a significant decline in the 5-year incidence of CIN3+ (from 0.96% [95% CI 0.85-1.09%] to 0.16% [95% CI 0.10-0.25%]; p < 0.0001) and cervical cancer (from 0.10% [95% CI 0.07%-0.15%] to 0.025% [95% CI 0.01-0.08%]; p = 0.01) between the first and subsequent rounds. Approximately 90% (246/274) of CIN3+ cases were diagnosed at first colposcopy. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in disease rates with 5-yearly co-testing seems mainly attributable to HPV testing since no CIN3+ occurred in HPV-/Pap+ women.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate clinical and radiological factors predicting worse outcome after (chemo)radiotherapy ([C]RT) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) with a focus on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). METHODS: This retrospective study included 67 OPSCC patients, treated with (C)RT with curative intent and diagnosed during 2013-2017. Human papilloma virus (HPV) association was detected with p16 immunohistochemistry. Of all 67 tumors, 55 were p16 positive, 9 were p16 negative, and in 3 the p16 status was unknown. Median follow-up time was 38 months. We analyzed pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for factors predicting disease-free survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence (LRR), including primary tumor volume and the largest metastasis. Crude and p16-adjusted hazard ratios were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model. Interobserver agreement was evaluated. RESULTS: Disease recurred in 13 (19.4%) patients. High ADC predicted poor DFS, but not when the analysis was adjusted for p16. A break in RT (hazard ratio, HR = 3.972, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.445-10.917, p = 0.007) and larger metastasis volume (HR = 1.041, 95% CI 1.007-1.077, p = 0.019) were associated with worse DFS. A primary tumor larger than 7 cm(3) was associated with increased LRR rate (HR = 4.861, 1.042-22.667, p = 0.044). Among p16-positive tumors, mean ADC was lower in grade 3 tumors compared to lower grade tumors (0.736 vs. 0.883; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Low tumor ADC seems to be related to p16 positivity and therefore should not be used independently to evaluate disease prognosis or to choose patients for treatment deintensification.

AB  - As the primary screening test, E6/E7 mRNA has shown similar sensitivity for CIN3+ and lower positivity rate than the HPV DNA test. Nevertheless, the overall mRNA positivity is too high for immediate colposcopy, making a triage test necessary. The aim was to estimate the mRNA performance as a primary test with different triage strategies. All HPV DNA-positives were tested for mRNA, cytology and p16/ki67. A sample of HPV DNA-negatives was also tested for mRNA to estimate test specificity. We included all CIN3+ histologically diagnosed within 24 months since recruitment. Of the 41 127 participants, 7.7% were HPV DNA-positive, of which 66.4% were mRNA-positive. Among the HPV DNA-negatives, 10/1108 (0.9%) were mRNA-positive. Overall, 97 CIN3+ were found. If mRNA was used as the primary test, it would miss about 3% of all CIN3+ with a 22% reduction of positivity compared with HPV DNA. The weighted specificity estimate for <CIN2 was 94.5% (95% CI = 93.9%-94.9%) and sensitivity for CIN3+ was 96.9% (95% CI = 91.3%-99.1%). If all the weighted estimated 6.0% mRNA-positive women had been referred to colposcopy, PPV for CIN3+ would have been 4.2%. Cytology or p16/ki67 triage would decrease immediate referral to 1.7% and 2.0%, increasing PPV to 11.2% and 11.7%, respectively; total colposcopy referral would be 4.0% and 3.9%, respectively. As the primary screening test, the mRNA assay showed a positivity rate lower than that of HPV DNA, with a small number of CIN3+ missed. Triage with cytology or p16/ki67 would only marginally decrease overall colposcopy referral.

AB  - Cervical cancer screening by human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing with cytology triage is more effective than cytology testing. Compared to cytology, the HPV DNA test's higher sensitivity, which allows better protection with longer intervals, makes it necessary to triage the women with a positive result to compensate its lower specificity. We are conducting a large randomized clinical trial (New Technologies for Cervical Cancer 2 [NTCC2]) within organized population-based screening programs in Italy using HPV DNA as the primary screening test to evaluate, by the Aptima HPV assay (Hologic), the use of HPV E6-E7 mRNA in a triage test in comparison to cytology. By the end of June 2016, data were available for 35,877 of 38,535 enrolled women, 2,651 (7.4%) of whom were HPV DNA positive. Among the samples obtained, 2,453 samples were tested also by Aptima, and 1,649 (67.2%) gave a positive result. The proportion of mRNA positivity was slightly higher among samples tested for HPV DNA by the Cobas 4800 HPV assay (Roche) than by the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay (Qiagen). In our setting, the observed E6-E7 mRNA positivity rate, if used as a triage test, would bring a rate of immediate referral to colposcopy of about 4 to 5%. This value is higher than that observed with cytology triage for both immediate and delayed referrals to colposcopy. By showing only a very high sensitivity and thus allowing a longer interval for HPV DNA-positive/HPV mRNA-negative women, a triage by this test might be more efficient than by cytology.

AB  - Introduction: The use of HPV screening for the triage of ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) cytology results has been established as a sound standard by international trials whereas the data for other cytology findings are in part contradictory. There is a lack of long-term studies on the use of HPV triage in Germany. Materials and Methods: For the present study data from a primary HPV screening project involving women aged over 30 years, ongoing since 2006, and an epidemiological study on women aged between 20 and 27 years, ongoing since 2009, were used. Upon recruitment, all women underwent a smear test for cytology and screening for "high-risk" HPV using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2). If both tests were positive or if there were persisting remarkable cytology findings or a positive HPV test, then clarification by colposcopy was performed. Results: Altogether, among 282 women with Pap II-p (ASC-US), Pap III (ASC-H) or Pap IIID (LSIL + CIN2) and negative HPV test there was no case of CIN3+. Among the women under 30 years of age, however, 69 % (ASC-US) to 85 % (LSIL + CIN2) of the remarkable findings were HPV positive, also among the older women with Pap IIID, the 71 % prevalence of HPV was too high for a triage and even without triage there was a 23 % risk for CIN3+. On the other hand, of the women over 30 years old with ASC-US (Pap II-p) findings, only 21 % were positive for HPV and the risk for CIN3+ in this group was high at 29 %. Also for ASC-H (Pap III) findings in the age group of over 30 years with an HPV prevalence of 56 % there was an efficient triage for CIN3+. Discussion: In summary, the HPV triage of ASC-US (Pap II-p) findings in women aged over 30 years was found to be efficient; in contrast, LSIL + CIN2 (Pap IIID) findings in this age group justified an immediate referral to colposcopy whereas cytology control appeared to be sufficient for younger women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), obtained before and during chemoradiotherapy, in predicting locoregional failure relative to clinicopathological factors for patients with anal cancer. METHODS: 93 patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in a prospective observational study (NCT01937780). FDG-PET/CT was performed for all patients before treatment, and for a subgroup (n = 39) also 2 weeks into treatment. FDG-PET was evaluated with standardized uptake values (SUV(max/peak/mean)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and a proposed Z-normalized combination of MTV and SUV(peak) (ZMP). The objective was to predict locoregional failure using FDG-PET, tumor and lymph node stage, gross tumor volume (GTV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) status in univariate and bivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: N3 lymph node stage, HPV negative tumor, GTV, MTV, TLG and ZMP were in univariate analysis significant predictors of locoregional failure (p < 0.01), while SUV(max/peak/mean) were not (p > 0.2). In bivariate analysis HPV status was the most independent predictor in combinations with N3 stage, ZMP, TLG, and MTV (p < 0.02). The FDG-PET parameters at 2 weeks into radiotherapy decreased by 30-40 % of the initial values, but neither absolute nor relative decrease improved the prediction models. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment PET parameters are predictive of chemoradiotherapy outcome in anal cancer, although HPV negativity and N3 stage are the strongest single predictors. Predictions can be improved by combining HPV with PET parameters such as MTV, TLG or ZMP. PET 2 weeks into treatment does not provide added predictive value. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Pre-treatment PET parameters of anal cancer showed a predictive role independent of clinicopathological factors. Although the PET parameters show substantial reduction from pre- to mid-treatment, the changes were not predictive of chemoradiotherapy outcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the presented PIPAVIR (persistent infections with human papillomaviruses; http://www.pipavir.com ) subanalysis is to assess the performance of high-risk (hr) HPV-DNA genotyping as a method of primary cervical cancer screening and triage of HPV positive women to colposcopy compared to liquid-based cytology (LBC) in an urban female population. METHODS: Women, aged 30-60, provided cervicovaginal samples at the Family-Planning Centre, Hippokratio Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece, and the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Mare Klinikum, Kiel, Germany. Cytology and HPV genotyping was performed using LBC and HPV Multiplex Genotyping (MPG), respectively. Women positive for cytology [atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse] or hrHPV were referred for colposcopy. RESULTS: Among 1723/1762 women included in the final analysis, hrHPV and HPV16/18 prevalence was 17.7 and 9.6%, respectively. Cytology was ASCUS or worse in 7.6%. Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) was detected in 28 women (1.6%). Sensitivity of cytology (ASCUS or worse) and HPV DNA testing for the detection of CIN2+ was 50.0 and 100%, and specificity was 94.49 and 85.49%, respectively. The screening approach according to which only women positive for HPV16/18 and for hrHPV(non16/18) with ASCUS or worse were referred to colposcopy presented 78.57% sensitivity and 13.17% positive predictive value (PPV). CONCLUSIONS: HPV testing represents a more sensitive methodology for primary cervical cancer screening compared to cytology. For triage of HPV positive women to colposcopy, partial HPV genotyping offers better sensitivity than cytology, at the cost of higher number of colposcopies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The contemporary treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an area of debate. We report outcomes of a minimally invasive approach involving transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). METHODS: A consecutive series of patients (n = 153) undergoing primary TLM for oropharyngeal SCC from 2006 to 2013 was studied. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was determined by p16 immunohistochemistry and high-risk HPV DNA in situ hybridization. Survival analyses were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier statistics. RESULTS: Tumor subsites included tonsil (n = 94; 61.5%), tongue base (n = 38; 24.8%), and soft palate (n = 21; 13.7%), with the majority being American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III/IVa (n = 124; 81.0%) and HPV-positive (n = 101; 66.0%). Three-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 84.5%, 91.7%, and 78.2%, respectively. HPV-positivity portended favorable oncologic outcomes. One-year gastrostomy tube (G-tube) dependency was 1.3%. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single-center TLM oropharyngeal SCC series to date. Our data suggest that TLM +/- postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) results in at least as good oncologic outcomes as chemoradiotherapy (CRT), while conferring swallowing function advantages.

AB  - Introduction On 1 January 2020 the screening programme for the prevention of cervical cancer in women from the age of 35 years of the Statutory Health Insurance (GKV) in Germany changed from an annual cytology examination to cytological and HPV co-testing carried out every three years. A large standard diagnostics laboratory has been using liquid-based cytology (LBC) with computer-assisted screening (CAS) since 1 January 2020 to assess the samples. Patients and Methods The cytological and HPV results for all cases examined with co-testing from 01.01.2020 to 31.12.2021 (n = 395759) are reported and the cytology results obtained using co-testing are compared with the results obtained using only conventional primary cytology screening from the two previous years (n = 588192). Cytology tests were carried out using LBC and computer-assisted screening. A DNA PCR test which can identify 14 types of HPV was used for HPV testing. The cytology results are reported using the Munich Nomenclature III, which is mandatory in Germany, and converted to The Bethesda System (TBS). Problems occurring during the implementation phase are described here. Results A total of 983951 cases who had primary screening between 01.01.2018 and 31.12.2021 were analysed. The HR HPV-positive rate with co-testing for all age groups was 6.41%. Of this group, 16.31% were positive for HPV-16, 4.43% for HPV-18, and 71.40% had one or more of the other 12 HR HPV types. Several different HPV types were identified in 7.86% of cases. The HPV-positive rate for cases with unremarkable cytological findings was 4.03%. 0.46% of tests were technically invalid. The results of primary cytology screening for 2020/21 (LBC) were: Pap 0 (TBS: unsatisfactory) 0.09%, Pap I and Pap II-a (NILM) 96.82%, Pap II-p/g (~ASC-US/AGC) 1.23%, Pap III-p/g (~ASC-H/AGC) 0.19%, Pap III D1 (LSIL) 1.08%, Pap III D2 (HSIL) 0.31%, Pap IVa/b-p/g (HSIL/AIS) 0.18%, and Pap V-p/g (carcinoma) 0.01%. The rates for 2018/19 (conventional cytology without routine testing for HPV) were significantly higher for Pap II-p/g (1.64%) and significantly lower for Pap III-p/g (0.13%), Pap III D1 (0.45%), Pap III D2 (0.10%) and Pap IVa/b-p/g (0.05%). Conclusion Evaluation of the data for the two first years of cytology and HPV co-testing from a standard diagnostics laboratory found low HR HPV-positive rates. As regards the cytology tests, the Pap II-p/g rate was significantly lower and the >/= Pap III rate was significantly higher compared to the two previous years. This points to a probable higher sensitivity and specificity of the new method.

AB  - Radiomics focuses on extracting a large number of quantitative imaging features and testing both their correlation with clinical characteristics and their prognostic and predictive values. We propose a radiomic approach using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to decode the tumor phenotype and local recurrence in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). The contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences from baseline MRI examinations of OPSCC patients treated between 2008 and 2016 were retrospectively selected. Radiomic features were extracted using the IBEX software, and hiegrarchical clustering was applied to reduce features redundancy. The association of each radiomic feature with tumor grading and stage, HPV status, loco-regional recurrence within 2 years, considered as main endpoints, was assessed by univariate analysis and then corrected for multiple testing. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS/STAT(R) software. Thirty-two eligible cases were identified. For each patient, 1286 radiomic features were extracted, subsequently grouped into 16 clusters. Higher grading (G3 vs. G1/G2) was associated with lower values of GOH/65Percentile and GOH/85Percentile features (p=0.04 and 0.01, respectively). Positive HPV status was associated with higher values of GOH/10Percentile (p=0.03) and lower values of GOH/90Percentile (p=0.03). Loco-regional recurrence within 2 years was associated with higher values of GLCM3/4-7Correlation (p=0.04) and lower values of GLCM3/2-1InformationMeasureCorr1 (p=0.04). Results lost the statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. T stage was significantly correlated with 9 features, 4 of which (GLCM25/180-4InformationMeasureCorr2, Shape/MeanBreadth, GLCM25/90-1InverseDiffMomentNorm, and GLCM3/6-1InformationMeasureCorr1) retained statistical significance after False Discovery Rate correction. MRI-based radiomics is a feasible and promising approach for the prediction of tumor phenotype and local recurrence in OPSCC. Some radiomic features seem to be correlated with tumor characteristics and oncologic outcome however, larger collaborative studies are warranted in order to increase the statistical power and to obtain robust and validated results.

AB  - PURPOSE: Management of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN grade 2 or 3 (CIN2-3)] diagnosed during pregnancy is controversial. Monitoring with colposcopy and cytology every 8-12 weeks is advised by the most current guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: This study analyzes the course of disease in pregnant women with abnormal cytologies or clinically suspicious cervixes. RESULTS: In total, 139 pregnant women, at a median age of 31 years (range 19-49), treated at the Colposcopy Unit of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between 2011 and 2017 were identified. During pregnancy, at least one biopsy was performed on 70.5% of patients. In 84.7% of cases, CIN2-3 (CIN2 n = 14 (14.3%), CIN3 n = 69 (70.4%)) was detected, 7.1% (n = 7) of women were diagnosed with CIN1, while no dysplasia was found in 8.2% (n = 8) of cases. No interventions were necessary during pregnancy. Despite explicit invitation, only 72.3% of women with CIN2-3 attended postpartal consultations. While 61.7% showed persistent lesions, 5% were diagnosed with CIN1 and 33.3% with complete remission. During pregnancy, 68.7% of women with prepartal CIN2-3 were tested for HPV infection. Later, 49.1% were followed up postpartally by means of HPV testing and histology. HPV clearance was observed in 36.4% of women with complete histological remission. Postpartum conization was performed on 44.6% of patients with prepartal CIN2-3 diagnosis. CIN2-3 was histologically confirmed in 97.3% cases. Progression from persistent CIN3 to microinvasive carcinoma was observed in a single case. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade CIN lesions, diagnosed during pregnancy, show a high rate of regression postpartum; whereas, progression to carcinoma is rare. Close and continuous monitoring rarely has any therapeutic consequences. Compliance for postpartal follow-up needs to be improved.

AB  - Women persistently infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 are at high risk for development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or cervical cancer (CIN3+). We aimed to identify biomarkers for progression to CIN3+ in women with persistent HPV16 infection. In this prospective study, 11,088 women aged 20-29 years were enrolled during 1991-1993, and re-invited for a second visit two years later. Cervical cytology samples obtained at both visits were tested for HPV DNA by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), and HC2-positive samples were genotyped by INNO-LiPA. The cohort was followed for up to 19 years via a national pathology register. To identify markers for progression to CIN3+, we performed microarray analysis on RNA extracted from cervical swabs of 30 women with persistent HPV16-infection and 11 HPV-negative women. Six genes were selected and validated by quantitative PCR. Three genes were subsequently validated within a different and large group of women from the same cohort. Secondly, Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were used to investigate whether expression levels of those three genes predict progression to CIN3+. We found that high transcript levels of TMEM45A, SERPINB5 and p16INK4a at baseline were associated with increased risk of CIN3+ during follow-up. The hazard ratios of CIN3+ per 10-fold increase in baseline expression level were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.3) for TMEM45A, 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.5) for p16INK4a, and 1.8 (95% CI: 1.2-2.7) for SERPINB5. In conclusion, high mRNA expression levels of TMEM45A, SERPINB5 and p16INK4a were associated with increased risk of CIN3+ in persistently HPV16-infected women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with borderline/mildly dyskaryotic (BMD) cytology smears are currently followed up with repeat testing at 6 and 18 months. The objective of this study is to analyse the cross-sectional and longitudinal performance of p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) and CIN2+ in women with BMD, and to compare the results with baseline human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. METHODS: Conventional Pap cytology specimens of 256 women with BMD were dual stained for p16/Ki-67 retrospectively, and compared with baseline HPV results and long-term follow-up results. RESULTS: p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 64.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100.% for CIN3+. Human papillomavirus testing demonstrated similar sensitivity (96.3%), and NPV (99.1%), but a significantly lower specificity (57.6%; P=0.024) for CIN3+. Sensitivity, specificity and NPV for CIN2+ of dual-stained cytology were 89.7%, 73.1% and 95.1%, respectively, which was similar when compared with HPV testing. Dual-stained cytology showed a significant lower referral rate than HPV testing (43.6% vs 49.1%; P=0.043). During long-term follow-up, no CIN3+ lesions developed in HPV-positive, dual-stained negative women. CONCLUSIONS: Comparable sensitivity and NPV of dual-stained cytology for CIN3+, combined with a significantly higher specificity, makes p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology a viable alternative to HPV testing for triaging BMD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The proxy marker for human papillomavirus (HPV), p16, is included in the new AJCC 8th/UICC 8th staging system, but due to incongruence between p16 status and HPV infection, single biomarker evaluation could lead to misallocation of patients. We established nomograms for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and known HPV-DNA and p16 status, and validated the models in cohorts from high- and low-prevalent HPV countries. METHODS: Consecutive OPSCC patients treated in Denmark, 2000-2014 formed the development cohort. The validation cohorts were from Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We developed nomograms by applying a backward-selection procedure for selection of variables, and assessed model performance. RESULTS: In the development cohort, 1313 patients, and in the validation cohorts, 344 German, 503 Swedish and 463 British patients were included. For the OS nomogram, age, gender, combined HPV-DNA and p16 status, smoking, T-, N-, and M-status and UICC-8 staging were selected, and for the PFS nomogram the same variables except UICC-8 staging. The nomograms performed well in discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Our nomograms are reliable prognostic methods in patients with OPSCC. Combining HPV DNA and p16 is essential for correct prognostication. The nomograms are available at www.orograms.org .

AB  - Background: The optimal management of vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (vHSILs) is challenging. Surgery is the standard treatment, but recurrences are observed in half of patients. Medical treatment with imiquimod is an effective alternative, but the two modalities have not been compared in a randomised trial. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness, histological response, human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance, acceptance, and psychosexual morbidity of primary imiquimod treatment versus surgical treatment in women with vHSIL. Method(s): This study was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority clinical trial done by the Austrian Gynaecological Oncology group at six hospitals in Austria. We recruited female patients aged 18-90 years with histologically confirmed vHSIL with visible unifocal or multifocal lesions. Main exclusion criteria were clinical suspicion of invasion, a history of vulvar cancer or severe inflammatory dermatosis of the vulva, and any active treatment for vHSIL within the previous 3 months. Women with known immunodeficiency, who were pregnant, or who were lactating were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by block randomisation to imiquimod or surgery, and stratified by unifocal or multifocal disease. Treatment with imiquimod was self-administered in a slowly escalating dosage scheme up to three times per week for a period of 4-6 months. Surgery consisted of excision or ablation. Patients were assessed with vulvoscopy, vulvar biopsy, HPV tests, and patient-reported outcomes at baseline and after 6 months and 12 months. The primary endpoint was complete clinical response (CCR) at 6 months after local imiquimod treatment or one surgical intervention. Primary analysis was per protocol with a non-inferiority margin of 20%. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01861535. Finding(s): 110 patients with vHSIL (78% with unifocal vHSIL and 22% with multifocal vHSIL) were randomly assigned between June 7, 2013, and Jan 8, 2020. Clinical response to treatment could be assessed in 107 patients (54 in the imiquimod group and 53 in the surgery group), and 98 patients (46 in the imiquimod group and 52 in the surgery group) completed the study per protocol. 37 (80%) of 46 patients using imiquimod had CCR, compared with 41 (79%) of 52 patients after one surgical intervention, showing non-inferiority of the new treatment (difference in proportion -0.016, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.18; p=0.0056). Invasive disease was found in five patients at primary or secondary surgery, but not in patients with per-protocol imiquimod treatment. There was no significant difference in HPV clearance, adverse events, and treatment satisfaction between study groups. Interpretation(s): Imiquimod is a safe, effective, and well accepted alternative to surgery for women with vHSIL and can be considered as first-line treatment.

AB  - Tumor cells frequently overexpress heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and present it on their cell surface, where it can be recognized by pre-activated NK cells. In our retrospective study the expression of Hsp70 was determined in relation to tumor-infiltrating CD56(+) NK cells in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens of patients with SCCHN (N = 145) as potential indicators for survival and disease recurrence. All patients received radical surgery and postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy (RCT). In general, Hsp70 expression was stronger, but with variable intensities, in tumor compared to normal tissues. Patients with high Hsp70 expressing tumors (scores 3-4) showed significantly decreased overall survival (OS; p = 0.008), local progression-free survival (LPFS; p = 0.034) and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS; p = 0.044), compared to those with low Hsp70 expression (scores 0-2), which remained significant after adjustment for relevant prognostic variables. The adverse prognostic value of a high Hsp70 expression for OS was also observed in patient cohorts with p16- (p = 0.001), p53- (p = 0.0003) and HPV16 DNA-negative (p = 0.001) tumors. The absence or low numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD56(+) NK cells also correlated with significantly decreased OS (p = 0.0001), LPFS (p = 0.0009) and DMFS (p = 0.0001). A high Hsp70 expression and low numbers of tumor-infiltrating NK cells have the highest negative predictive value (p = 0.00004). In summary, a strong Hsp70 expression and low numbers of tumor-infiltrating NK cells correlate with unfavorable outcome following surgery and RCT in patients with SCCHN, and thus serve as negative prognostic markers.

AB  - The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OSCC) is on the rise. With the HPV-positive uterine cervix as a reservoir, HPV-positive OSCC is discussed as a sexually transmitted disease. Mechanisms of HPV transmission to the oral cavity are poorly understood. To gain more insight into HPV-transmission routes, cervically HPV-positive women and their sexual partners are screened for oral HPV infection. Women with cervical dysplasia underwent HPV testing of the uterine cervix and tonsillar region via brush test. In addition, sexual partners received oral HPV testing. Tonsillar brush tests of patients admitted for routine surgery served as the control group. The HPV-PCR (Roche Linear Array Kit) was used to differentiate 37 HPV types. All participants completed a risk-factor questionnaire focusing on sexual habits. 101 women were tested HPV-positive at the cervix. Only 3/101 (3 %) were tested HPV-positive in the oropharynx. In 60/101 (60 %) women the sexual partner could be tested for oral HPV infection: testing was positive in 3/60 (5 %). No oral HPV was detected in the control group. The risk-factor questionnaire revealed significant differences between the female study- and control group in terms of age at first sexual intercourse and smoking habits. The limited data suggest that among sexual partners in Germany, HPV transmission to the oropharynx by oral-genital sex or by autoinoculation is a rare and unlikely event with low HPV concordance. Another explanation for the low oral prevalence could be an independent clearance of HPV from the oropharyngeal site compared to cervix uteri or at different time intervals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) are responsible for a broad spectrum of mucocutaneous infections and may cause squamous cell carcinoma following long-standing infection . Oncogenic HPV, most commonly HPV 16, are detectable in over 90% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is strongly associated with a higher prevalence of chronic HPV infection, a higher incidence of AIN and an increased risk for anal cancer (AC). In September 2013, guidelines concerning prevention, screening and treatment of AIN for patients affected by HIV were issued by the German AIDS society. OBJECTIVE: In order to validate the suggested screening procedure, we analysed data from 123 male and female patients with HIV infection that regularly present in our outpatient clinic. METHODS: Anal cytology, HPV typing and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) were performed. RESULTS: Our results show that screening by anal cytology only identifies a minority of patients with high grade AIN (AIN 3) histology. Patients with normal cytology (NILM, cytology graded negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy; n = 5, 29.4%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS; n = 5, 71.4%) and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL; n = 8, 44.5%) showed highly dysplastic lesions (AIN 2 and 3) in the histological workup more frequently than expected. Additionally, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was strongly associated with detection of high-risk oncogenic HPV. CONCLUSION: Anal cytology as the solitary screening tool for anal cancer fails to detect anal dysplasia in a considerable number of patients. Additionally, HPV typing and possibly further biomarkers might be applied to identify those patients with a higher risk of developing anal carcinoma, in order to monitor them more closely or directly transfer them to HRA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) testing has been shown to be a valuable tool in cervical cancer screening for the detection of cervical pre-cancer and cancer. METHODS: We report a purely observational study evaluating HR HPV prevalences in residual liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples using both the Cervista HPV HR Test and the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA Test (HC2) in a sample of 1,741 women aged >/=30 years of a German routine screening population of 13,372 women. Test characteristics were calculated and a novel method for measuring test performances was applied by calculating ratios of sensitivity or specificity. RESULTS: The overall agreement of both tests for detection of HR HPV was excellent (kappa = 0.8). Relative sensitivities for the detection of histologically confirmed severe cervical intraepithelial dysplasia (CIN3+) were similar for both HPV-tests, which was confirmed by the ratio analysis. However, discrepancy analysis between the Cervista HPV HR test and HC2 revealed a high false positive rate of the Cervista HPV HR test in the cytology normal category. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of the Cervista HPV test in cervical specimens with abnormal cytology is comparable to HC2 as both tests were highly sensitive and specific for the detection of high grade cervical disease. We also demonstrate evidence that modification of the cut-off values drastically reduces the false positive rate in the cytology normal category without affecting the detection of CIN3+, which ultimately improved specificity of the Cervista HPV HR assay.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The etiology of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) can influence the efficacy of Public Health preventive strategies. This study aimed to determine the high-risk papillomavirus (HR-HPV) prevalence in CIN2+ cases in unvaccinated women in Galicia (Spain), the expected impact of bivalent vaccination, and the distribution of HPV 16 in squamous lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-four histologically confirmed cases of CIN2+ (2009-2010) were retrospectively studied: 23 CIN2, 58 CIN3- squamous carcinoma in situ (CIN3-CIS), 5 adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and 8 invasive squamous cervical cancer (SCC). Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was performed on the cervical specimens. Bivalent vaccination impact was calculated, based on regional vaccination coverage data, local HR-HPV prevalence, and reported efficacy (direct and cross-protection) of the vaccine. RESULTS: HR-HPV prevalence was 96.8%. The most frequent genotypes were HPV 16 (48.8-58.2%) and HPV 31 (9.3%-12.1%), considering single infections or single-multiple infections, respectively (hierarchical attribution). In squamous lesions, HPV 16 prevalence in women younger than 45 years of age increased in severe lesions (CIN3-CIS/SCC, OR 4.2), and was higher than in older women (OR 5.5). The vaccine could reduce the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ by 50.6% (direct protection), or by 62.7% (direct and cross-protection). CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination could have a great impact in women younger than 45 years of age due to the high prevalence of HPV 16 in their lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with locally advanced SCCHN have a poor prognosis. This study investigated the prognostic value of the tumor cell expression of the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in patients treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The impact of FGF-2-expression and 11 additional potential prognostic factors on loco-regional control (LRC), metastases-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS) was retrospectively evaluated in 146 patients. Additional factors included age, gender, performance status, pre-radiotherapy hemoglobin levels, tumor site, histologic grade, T-category, N-category, human papilloma virus (HPV) status, extent of resection, and chemotherapy. Univariate analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, multivariate analyses with the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, improved LRC was significantly associated with FGF-2-negativity [risk ratio (RR): 7.33; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 2.88-19.05; p<0.001], lower T-category (RR: 2.42; 95%-CI: 1.47-4.33; p<0.001), lower N-category (RR: 12.36; 95%-CI: 3.48-78.91; p<0.001), and pre-radiotherapy hemoglobin levels >/= 12 g/dl (RR: 4.18; 95%-CI: 1.73-10.53; p=0.002). No factor was significantly associated with improved MFS. Lower T-category showed a trend (RR: 1.59; 95%-CI: 0.97-2.82; p=0.069). Better OS was significantly associated with FGF-2-negativity (RR: 5.10; 2.22-11.80; p<0.001), lower T-category (RR: 2.17; 95%-CI: 1.38-3.68; p < 0.001), lower N-category (RR: 3.86; 95%-CI: 1.60-10.85; p=0.002), and pre-radiotherapy hemoglobin levels >/= 12 g/dl (RR: 3.20; 95%-CI: 1.46-7.30; p=0.004). HPV-positivity showed a trend (RR: 2.36; 95%-CI: n.a.; p=0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell expression of FGF-2 proved to be an independent prognostic factor for LRC and OS. This factor can help personalize treatment and stratify patients in future trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of HPV status in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received surgery and cisplatin-based postoperative radiochemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 221 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity treated at the 8 partner sites of the German Cancer Consortium, the impact of HPV DNA, p16 overexpression and p53 expression on outcome were retrospectively analysed. The primary endpoint was loco-regional tumour control; secondary endpoints were distant metastases and overall survival. RESULTS: In the total patient population, univariate analyses revealed a significant impact of HPV16 DNA positivity, p16 overexpression, p53 positivity and tumour site on loco-regional tumour control. Multivariate analysis stratified for tumour site showed that positive HPV 16 DNA status correlated with loco-regional tumour control in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (p=0.02) but not in the oral cavity carcinoma group. Multivariate evaluation of the secondary endpoints in the total population revealed a significant association of HPV16 DNA positivity with overall survival (p<0.01) but not with distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: HPV16 DNA status appears to be a strong prognosticator of loco-regional tumour control after postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy of locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma and is now being explored in a prospective validation trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Non-surgical therapies are needed to reduce the rate of progression of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) to high grade CIN (CIN 2/3). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of hexaminolevulinate (HAL) photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of patients with CIN 1. STUDY DESIGN: This phase IIa prospective double-blind study randomized patients with CIN 1 into three groups: HAL vaginal suppository, placebo vaginal suppository or follow-up only. Patients in the first two groups received HAL or placebo suppositories 5 hours before illumination with 50 J/cm(2) red coherent light (633 nm) using a special light catheter. All patients had a follow up including colposcopy, cytology and human papilloma virus (HPV) testing 3 and 6 months and additional biopsy 6 months after PDT. The main outcome measure was efficacy, defined as complete histologic remission 6 months after PDT. Secondary outcomes were histologic remission 3 months and HPV eradication 6 months after first PDT. RESULTS: Seventy patients were randomized: 47 to HAL, 12 to placebo, 11 to follow up only. After 6 months CIN lesions had cleared in 57% of patients in the HAL-PDT group compared to 25% in the combined control group (per protocol population, P = 0.04). Twenty-six patients (37%) reported 44 adverse events (AEs), of which 40 were mild or moderate. Nineteen treatment-related AEs were reported by 15 patients (32%) in the HAL PDT group, one in the placebo PDT group (8%), and none in the follow-up group. The most common adverse events were local discomfort including mild pain/cramping (11) and leucorrhoea (2). CONCLUSION: HAL PDT shows a favorable efficacy and safety profile and represents a promising alternative to observation and surgical procedures in patients with CIN 1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of HPV-mRNA test in the follow-up after LEEP is still matter of debate, with regard to its capacity of prediction relapse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the reliability of HPV-mRNA test to predict the residual and recurrent disease, and its accuracy in the follow-up of patients treated for CIN 2/3. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study. Patients who underwent LEEP after a biopsy diagnosing CIN 2/3 were followed at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Each check up included cytology, colposcopy, HPV-DNA test (LiPA) and HPV-mRNA test (PreTect HPV Proofer Kit NorChip). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), of HPV-DNA test and HPV-mRNA test to predict relapse, recurrent and residual disease. Using multiple logistic regression, the statistical significant variables as assessed in univariate analysis were entered and investigated as predictors of relapse disease. RESULTS: The mRNA-test in predicting a residual disease had a sensitivity of 52% and a NPV of 91%, whereas DNA-test had 100% and 100%, respectively. On the contrary in the prediction of recurrent disease mRNA-test had a sensitivity and a NPV of 73.5% and 97%, whereas DNA-test had 44% and 93%. On the multivariate analysis, age, cytology, HPV DNA and mRNA test achieved the role of independent predictors of relapse. CONCLUSION: HPV-mRNA test has a higher sensitivity and a higher NPV in predicting recurrent disease, for this reason it should be used in the follow-up of patients treated with LEEP for CIN 2/3 in order to individualize the timing of check up.

AB  - Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is the key event in the progression of HPV lesions, and more data are urgently needed on asymptomatic oral HPV infections in men. Asymptomatic fathers-to-be (n = 131, mean age 28.9 years) were enrolled in the cohort, sampled by serial oral scrapings at baseline and at 2-month, 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, 36-month, and 7-year follow-up visits to accomplish persistent and cleared HPV infections. HPV genotyping was performed using nested PCR and Multimetrix(R) assay. Covariates of persistent and cleared oral HPV infections were analysed using generalised estimating equation (GEE) and Poisson regression. Altogether, 17 HPV genotypes were detected in male oral mucosa point prevalence, varying from 15.1 % to 31.1 %. Genotype-specific HPV persistence was detected in 18/129 men the mean persistence time ranging from 6.0 to 30.7 months. History of genital warts decreased (p = 0.0001; OR = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.33-0.51) and smoking increased (p = 0.033, OR = 1.92, 95 % CI 1.05-3.50) the risk of persistent species 7/9 HPV infections. Of the 74 HPV-positive men, 71.6 % cleared their infection actuarial and crude clearance times, varying between 1.4 and 79.6 months. No independent predictors were identified for species 7/9 clearance. At the last follow-up-visit, 50.1 % of the fathers had oral mucosal changes, correlating only with smoking (p = 0.046). To conclude, most of the persisting oral infections in males were caused by HPV16. Smoking increased while previous genital warts decreased oral HR-HPV persistence. No predictors of HR-HPV clearance were disclosed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is a common disease, which has a poor prognosis after failure of therapy. Activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis is commonly detected in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, and provided the rationale for the clinical phase II trial in pretreated SCCHN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary end point was the progression-free survival rate (PFR) at 12 weeks. Forty eligible patients have been recruited after failure of platinum chemotherapy and cetuximab. A preplanned futility analysis was successfully passed after >/=1 success was detected in 20 patients. Secondary objectives consisted of progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability, and predictive biomarkers for KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations, and HPV status. Archived tumor tissue was analyzed for DNA sequence. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were eligible. The PFR at 12 weeks was 40% (95% CI 25.0-54.6). The median PFS and OS were 56 days (95% CI 36-113 days) and 152 days (76-256 days), respectively. In 33 assessable patients, disease stabilization occurred in 57.6%, with tumor shrinkage in 13 patients (39.4%). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated. Fatigue (47.5%), anemia (25.0%), nausea (20.0%), and pneumonia (20.0%) were the most common adverse events. Neither PIK3CA mutations, nor HPV status were predictive for success with temsirolimus treatment. No mutations were found for KRAS or BRAF. CONCLUSION: Tumor shrinkage and efficacy parameter indicate that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis was a putative novel treatment paradigm for SCCHN. We could not identify parameters predictive for treatment success of temsirolimus, which underscores the need for refinement of the molecular analysis in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The triage of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women is needed to avoid overreferral to colposcopy. p16(INK4a) immunostaining is an efficient triage method. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 dual staining was introduced mainly to increase reproducibility and specificity compared with stand-alone p16(INK4a) staining. METHODS: Within a pilot project, HPV-positive women were referred to colposcopy if cytology was abnormal or unsatisfactory or HPV testing was still positive after 1 year. For 500 consecutive women, a slide obtained during colposcopy was immunostained for p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 and independently interpreted by 7 readers without previous experience with dual staining. Four of these readers were experts in cervical pathology and 3 were not. Kappa values for multiple raters, sensitivity, and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 2-positive histology were computed. Because women with normal cytology were underrepresented, estimates for all HPV-positive women were obtained as weighted means of cytology-specific estimates. RESULTS: The overall kappa for HPV-positive women was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.60-0.77). Kappa values were not found to be significantly different between expert and nonexpert readers with regard to cervical cytology but were significantly increased (P =. 0066) after consensus discussion. The overall specificity estimate for HPV-positive women was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.4%-70.2%): 66.7% (95% CI, 59.8%-73.0%) for experts and 60.5% (95% CI, 59.8%-73.0%) for nonexperts. Among women with abnormal cytology, the sensitivity was 85.5% (95% CI, 77.9%-90.8%): 85.8% (95% CI, 77.9%-91.2%) for experts and 85.1% (95% CI, 76.6%-90.9%) for nonexperts. CONCLUSIONS: p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 immunostaining demonstrated good reproducibility and specificity when triaging HPV-positive women. Dual-staining interpretation can be performed, after short training, even by staff who are not experts in cervical cytology. This allows HPV-based screening with triage to be performed in settings in which such expert staff is not available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Testing for the presence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) is widely accepted for triaging Papanicolaou cytology results categorized as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). In contrast, HPV testing has limited use in triaging cytological low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) due to prevalence rates of typically >80%. In the current study, the authors assessed the diagnostic performance of p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology in triaging ASC-US and LSIL cases within the prospective, multicentric Primary ASC-US LSIL Marker Study (PALMS). METHODS: A total of 575 ASC-US cases and 529 LSIL cases from a cohort of 27,349 women who were prospectively enrolled into the PALMS study in 5 European countries were tested with p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV testing. Colposcopy-guided biopsy results of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were used as clinical endpoints. RESULTS: p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology demonstrated comparable (ASC-US: 94.4% for dual-stained cytology vs 100% for HC2 testing; P = .317) or lower (LSIL: 85.7% for dual-stained cytology vs 98.4% for HC2 testing; P = .005) sensitivity for CIN2+, but higher levels of specificity compared with HC2 HPV testing in both ASC-US (78.7% vs 60.4%; P<.001) and LSIL (53.3% vs 15.6%; P<.001) cases. Positive predictive values for CIN2+ were substantially higher for dual-stained cytology versus HC2 HPV testing, especially in LSIL, and in ASC-US cases for women aged <30 years. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical usefulness and efficiency of triaging women with ASC-US or LSIL Papanicolaou cytology results by p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology testing has been confirmed in this prospective, pan-European study. The high positive predictive value of dual-stained cytology for the presence of high-grade CIN may help to reduce the number of unnecessary colposcopy referrals.

AB  - Recently, we demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between HPV-infection and SLPI-expression suggesting that SLPI protects against HPV-infection of HNSCC. Here we analyzed in a single lab setting 307 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HNSCC cases (tonsillar n = 135; non-tonsillar: n = 172) from eight health care centers. Samples were analyzed for SLPI gene- and protein-expression. Annexin A2, its heterotetramer A2t, putatively facilitating HPV- and SLPI-cell entry, was measured to study the correlation between SLPI and annexin A2. Data were correlated with tobacco consumption and HPV-status. Overall, HPV-DNA prevalence was 23.5% (72/307); attributed to: 43.7% (59/135) tonsillar and 7.6% (13/172) non-tonsillar cases. Smoking resulted in 6.44-fold increased and HPV-infection in 3.46-fold decreased SLPI-gene expression in all HNSCC with similar significant results obtained in tonsillar and non-tonsillar SCC separately. Correlating annexin A2- and SLPI-gene expression showed a significant surplus of annexin A2 in HPV-positive tumors (4.21x more annexin A2) and 6.72x more annexin A2 than SLPI in nonsmokers in all HNSCCs and similar significant results for both tumor entities separately. The surplus of annexin A2 in non-smokers and HPV-positive patients supports our hypothesis that decreased SLPI levels facilitate HPV-infection i.e., increased SLPI-expression may protect against HPV-infection of tonsillar and non-tonsillar SCC.

AB  - Rising prevalence rates of high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPV) infection in oropharyngeal carcinoma (up to 80 %) have been reported in North America and Scandinavia. We have analysed 424 German and 163 Brazilian head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) from the oral cavity (OSCC), oropharynx (OPSCC) and hypopharynx (HPSCC) using p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV DNA PCR and sequencing, hrHPV DNA in situ hybridisation (ISH) and hrHPV E6/E7 RNA ISH. In the German series, 52/424 cases (12.3 %) were p16-positive/hrHPV-positive (OSCC 3.8 % [10/265], OPSCC 34.4 % [42/122], HPSCC 0 % [0/37]). In addition, there were 9 cases that were p16-positive/hrHPV-negative (5 OPSCC and 4 OSCC). In the Brazilian series, the overall hrHPV DNA prevalence by PCR was 11.0 % ([18/163]; OSCC 6 % [5/83], OPSCC 15.5 % [11/71], HPSCC 22.2 % [2/9]). Ten of these cases were hrHPV-positive/p16-positive. The remaining 8 hrHPV-positive/p16-negative cases were also negative in both ISH assays. Furthermore, 5 p16-positive/hrHPV-negative cases (2 OPSCC and 3 OSCC) were identified. In both series, HPV16 was by far the most common HPV type detected. We confirm that regardless of geographical origin, the highest hrHPV prevalence in HNSCC is observed in oropharyngeal carcinomas. The proportion of HPV-associated OPSCC was substantially higher in the German cohort than in the Brazilian series (34.4 vs. 15.5 %), and in both groups, the prevalence of hrHPV in OPSCC was much lower than in recent reports from North America and Scandinavia. We suggest, therefore, that it may be possible to define areas with high (e.g. USA, Canada, Scandinavia), intermediate (e.g. Germany) and low (e.g. Brazil) prevalences of HPV infection in OPSCC.

AB  - In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the long-term risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or cancer (CIN3+) by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) genotype and semi-quantitative viral load at baseline among 33,288 women aged 14-90 years with normal baseline cytology. During 2002-2005, residual liquid-based cervical cytology samples were collected from women screened for cervical cancer in Copenhagen, Denmark. Samples were HPV-tested with Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and genotyped with INNO-LiPA. Semi-quantitative viral load was measured by HC2 relative light units in women with single hrHPV infections. The cohort was followed in a nationwide pathology register for up to 11.5 years. In women aged >/=30 years at baseline, the 8-year absolute risk for CIN3+ following baseline detection of HPV16 was 21.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.0-25.6%). The corresponding risks for HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, and other hrHPV types, respectively, were 12.8% (95% CI: 7.6-18.0%), 11.3% (95% CI: 7.7-14.9%), 12.9% (95% CI: 7.0-18.8%) and 3.9% (95% CI: 2.7-5.2%). Similar absolute risk estimates were observed in women aged <30 years. Higher HPV16-viral load was associated with increased risk of CIN3+ (hazard ratio = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.10-1.64, per 10-fold increase in viral load). A similar trend, although statistically nonsignificant, was found for viral load of HPV18. The 8-year absolute risk of CIN3+ in women with HPV16-viral load >/=100.0 pg/ml was 30.2% (95% CI: 21.9-38.6%). Our results support that hrHPV genotyping during cervical cancer screening may help identify women at highest risk of CIN3+.

AB  - The increased knowledge regarding HPV-infections in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has unexpectedly contributed to several uncertainties related to i) prevalence diversities depending on tumour site and geographical origin of the patients, ii) proportion of HPV-driven tumours among HPV-DNA-positive cases, and iii) identification of patients with HPV-attributed survival benefit. To investigate this heterogeneity, we analysed 307 HNSCC cases (tonsillar, n=135; non-tonsillar, n=172) from eight health care centers mostly from Northern Germany and determined HPV-DNA/mRNA and p16INK4A-status and combined results with the patient outcome. Overall HPV-DNA prevalence rate was 23.5% (72/307); attributed to: 43.7% (59/135) and 7.6% (13/172) tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases, respectively. Among these, 96.6% tonsillar and 38.5% non-tonsillar SCC were HPV-mRNA-positive. Although the study cohort was composed of patients from regions of rather close proximity, prevalence rates showed diversities of up to 40% in HNSCC subsite analysis with the lowest prevalence for tonsillar SCC in metropolitan areas (22.2%) vs. 50.9% in rural areas. Survival analysis identified p16INK4A alone as strongest predictor, followed by HPV-DNA-status alone or in combination with p16INK4A. This survival benefit was shown for tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases. Smoking significantly correlated with HPV-status, however, it does not influence survival when stratified for HPV. In conclusion, the data emphasize the urge for further data on HPV-infection in HNSCC to, e.g. clarify to what extent survival benefits of p16INK4A-positive patients are truly attributed to HPV-infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increases in incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in countries with falling tobacco use have been attributed to a growing role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in the carcinogenesis. Trends of HPV prevalence in populations with persistently high portions of smokers are poorly characterised. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Registry data from East Germany were used to determine incidence trends between 1998 and 2011. Data from patients treated at the Charite University Medicine Berlin between 2004 and 2013 (cohort 1, N=436) were used for estimation of trends in HPV prevalence, smoking and survival. HPV prevalence was prospectively confirmed in cohort 2 (N=213) comprising all primary HNSCC cases at the Charite in 2013. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2011 incidence of both OPSCC and non-OPSCC increased. An increase in HPV prevalence (% of HPV+ cases in 2004-2006 versus 2012-2013: 27% versus 59%, P=0.0004) accompanied by a moderate decrease in the portion of current smokers was observed in OPSCC but not in non-OPSCC. The change in disease epidemiology in OPSCC was associated with significant improvement in overall survival. Increased HPV prevalence in OPSCC (48%) compared to non-OPSCC (11%) was confirmed in cohort 2. CONCLUSIONS: Despite clear differences to the United States in terms of tobacco use, the increase in OPSCC incidence in a European population was also mainly attributed to HPV, and the HPV status significantly affected prognosis. For clinical trial design it is important to consider the large group of smokers within HPV-induced OPSCC.

AB  - Objective: The impact of HPV status was recently confirmed for adjuvant cis-platin based radiochemotherapy in HNSCC patients by DKTK-ROG. However, novel molecular markers of therapy response in HPV-negative HNSCC are urgently needed. Towards this goal, the epigenetic landscape of HPV-negative HNSCC was interrogated via methylome analysis. Method(s): From 221 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity treated at the 8 DKTK-ROG partner sites, 71 were HPV16 DNA positive, 1 HPV18, 1 HPV16 + 18 double positive and 1 HPV13 DNA positive. Expression of p16 was further evaluated in all patients but not considered as selection criteria. In total, 141 HPV-DNA negative patients were subject of this study. Tumor localization, loco-regional tumour control; distant metastases and overall survival (OS) were detected as endpoints for comparative analysis. So far, DNA isolated from Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue of 80 patients passed the initial QC, was bisulfite converted and hybridizied on Illumina Human Methylation 450 K according to the Infinium Methylation protocol. Genomewide methylation status of 485.577 CpG dinucleotides was interrogated in parallel. Data processing, clustering and statistical analysis was performed using the in house Statistical Utility for Microarray and Omics data (SUMO) software package. Result(s): 51 sites were differentially methylated as the function of tumor localization (p < 0.05, ANOVA, after Bonferroni multiple testing correction), mainly discriminating between oral cavity vs. Oro-/Hypopharynx as determined by clustering analysis. By stratifying patients according to differential tumor methylation status (1. vs. 4. quartile) top 100 methylation sites were identified to significantly discriminate between patients with good vs. poor prognosis as determined by OS (p < 0.00002, Mantel-Cox, log-rank test). The quality of these 100 methylation sites to classify patients was further confirmed by leave two out cross validation using K-Nearest-Neighbours (KNN, 5 neightbours) and Euclidean distance. Finally, 2640 methylation sites were found at p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected, to correlate with the primary endpoint of the study - the locoregional tumor control. Conclusion(s): This is, to our knowledge, the first report on discovery of methylation signature based epigenetic prognosticators for locoregional control and survival after radiochemotherapy in locally advanced HNSCC.

AB  - Background: The genetic landscape of SCCHN is currently being unravelled by an increasing number of studies using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The role of distinct mutational patterns for treatment outcome remains largely unknown. We here analyzed mutational patterns of HPV+ and HPV- tumors and compared results with outcome after uniform chemoradiation. Method(s): Archival tumor specimens from 208 patients with LASCCHN of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity, all uniformly treated with surgery and adjuvant cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy at one of the eight partner sites of the German Cancer Consortium were included in this study. An in-house gene panel for semiconductor-based sequencing, covering 211 exons from 45 genes frequently altered in SCCHN was used for mutational analysis. Genetic alterations were correlated with HPV status, clinical risk parameters and patient outcome. Finding(s): Mutational profiles were successfully established for 185 SCCHN cases. Interestingly, HPV+ carcinomas were significantly enriched for activating mutations in driver genes (PIK3CA 27%, KRAS 8%, NRAS 4%, HRAS 2%) compared to HPV- cases (P = 0.002). Conversely, HPV- tumors showed an increased frequency of loss-of-function alterations in tumor suppressor genes (TP53 67%, CDKN2A 30%, PTEN 4%, SMAD4 3%) compared to HPV+ cases (P< 0.001). After a median follow-up of 55 months, detection of alterations in tumor suppressor genes significantly increased the risk of death (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.8, P = 0.001), locoregional recurrence (HR 5.4, 95% CI 1.6-18.1, P = 0.006) and distant metastasis (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.1, P = 0.04). The occurrence of activating driver gene mutations did not significantly influence outcome in the total cohort of patients, however, they were associated per trend with increased risks of locoregional recurrence and death (HR 3.7, 95% CI 0.7-20.6, P = 0.12) in the subgroup of HPV+p16+ oropharyngeal carcinomas. Conclusion(s): Activating mutations in driver genes occuring in one third of HPV-driven SCCHN seem to negatively interfere with efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiation. These genes or their associated signaling pathways might represent therapeutic targets for improving cure rates of HPV+ disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Various epidemiological studies evaluated the relationship between HPV infection and bladder cancer with controversial results regarding HPV prevalence. The aim of this study was to determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) can be detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bladder cancer tissue using single-step PCR (HPV L1) for HPV identification, followed by reverse line blot (RLB) for genotyping. MATERIAL & METHODS: Patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) due to a primary, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) from 2006 to 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic and histopathological characteristics of the study population like patient age, gender, BMI (body mass index), preoperative CRP (C reactive protein), tumor staging (according to WHO 2009), tumor grading (according to WHO 1973 and 2004), cancer recurrence or progression during a minimum follow-up of 3 years were recorded. A control group of 22 cervical tissues with invasive cervical carcinoma was included. DNA was exctracted from FFPE tumor biopsies using Biorobot EZ1 (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany) by standardized automated manufactor's protocol and the AmpliQuality HPVType Express (AB Analytica, Padova, Italy) kit was used for both HPV identification and genotyping. RESULT(S): DNA was isolated from tumor samples of 186 patients (37 women, 149 men) with a mean (range) age of 72 (24-93) years who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A quality-control s-globin DNA fragment was amplified confirming adequate DNA for HPV analysis in all samples. Histology confirmed primary CIS in 14 (7.5%) patients, pTa tumors in 134 (72%) patients, pT1 tumors in 36 (19.4%) patients and pTa+pT1 tumors in 2 (1.1%) patients. 119 (63.9%) of them were low-risk, while 67 (36.1%) were high-risk. Tumor recurrence and progression (>=pT2) was seen in 79 (42.4%) and 11 (5.9%) patients after a mean follow-up of 45 months. The presence of HPV DNA by single-step PCR was detected in 4 (2.2%) patients. Using post-PCR-RLB for genotyping, HPV 16 and HPV 6 was positive in 2 (1.1%) and 1 (0.6%) patient. In 1 case, no HPV genotype listed on the RLB assay could be identified, although HPV-DNA was positive. In the control group, the HPV infection rate was 100% affirming HPV 16 positivity in 12 (54.6%) patients, HPV 16/18 in 4 (18.3%) patients, HPV 18 in 2 (9.1%) patients, HPV 16/45 in 1 patient (4.5%) and HPV 18/33 in1 (4.5%) patient, HPV 16/33 in 1 (4.5%) patient and HPV 33 in another 1 (4.5%) patient. CONCLUSION(S): Using post-PCR based RLB hybridization technique, adequate DNA quantity and quality was provided using beta-globin (BG) gene amplification; amplification step included the dUTP/UNG system to prevent contamination; a simultaneous control group (cervical FFPE samples) was tested HPV positive in 100% thus confirming the validity of the assay. Taken together, the applied protocol and the included quality controls exclude false negative results with utmost probability confirming low prevalence of HPV infection in FFPE bladder cancer tissue. This fact argues against the etiological role of HPV in urothelial carcinogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPV infections play a major role in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Regarding benign papillomas, the role of HPV is still uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To clarify this issue, 100 exophytic papillomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx were subjected to histopathological and molecular pathological examination. Excision biopsies were taken from 62 male and 38 female patients with an age range of 18 to 87 years. Biopsies were tested for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry and analyzed for HPV subtypes 6/11 (low-risk), 16/18 and 31/33/53 (high-risk) by chromogenic in situ hybridization. RESULTS: HPV infections were verified molecularly in 34 % of biopsies; in all cases with the low-risk HPV subtypes 6/11. Only one case showed infection with both 6/11 and 31/33/53 subtypes, but not subtype 16/18; whereas expression of p16 was found in 67 %. The rate of positive molecular verification of HPV infection (in situ hybridization) was highest in the laryngeal lesions with 61.1 %, followed by the oral cavity with 52.9 %, and lowest in pharyngeal lesions (21.5 %). Recurrent papillomas were seen in 18 cases (18 %), of which 14 were molecularly positive for HPV (in situ hybridization). A correlation between inflammatory infiltration and HPV infection could be verified in 82 %. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate an important role of HPV infection for the development of benign papillomas of the head and neck region. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between HPV infection and recurrent papillomas. Therefore, a molecular morphological HPV analysis of papillomas could provide important prognostic data.

AB  - Human papilloma virus (HPV) may cause mostly transient infections of cutaneous and mucous epithelia. Persistent HPV genital infections may induce pre-malignant or malignant lesions. While E6 and E7 HPV genes' malignant character is known, E5 is still under debate. We evaluated the possible role of E5 gene in cervix oncogenesis, in patients with abnormal cytology and HPV1 6 positive, in the context of viral status correlated with potential targets (p21, EGFR). HPV DNA was detected and genotyped using Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and E2, E6, E5 HPV16, p21 and EGFR transcripts levels were investigated by qRT-PCR. Our results indicate a significantly high E5 expression in low grade cytology, expression correlated with a moderated E6 and low p21 levels. All HSIL specimens presented integrated/mixed viral forms; mixed forms presented moderate E5 expression, high levels of p21 correlates with E6 oncogene high expression. These findings indicate a potential role for E5 pattern of expression in discriminating be-tween lesions that may progress to cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the tumour volume, HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures, as potential markers of radiobiological mechanisms of radioresistance, in a contemporary cohort of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received primary radiochemotherapy (RCTx). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 158 patients with locally advanced HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx or hypopharynx who were treated at six DKTK partner sites, the impact of tumour volume, HPV DNA, p16 overexpression, p53 expression, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of primary RCTx was retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control (LRC). RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression revealed a significant impact of tumour volume, p16 overexpression, and SLC3A2 and CD44 protein expression on LRC. The tumour hypoxia classification showed a significant impact only for small tumours. In multivariate analyses an independent correlation of tumour volume, SLC3A2 expression, and the 15-gene hypoxia signature with LRC was identified (CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group). Logistic modelling showed that inclusion of CD44 protein expression and p16 overexpression significantly improved the performance to predict LRC at 2years compared to the model with tumour volume alone. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour volume, HPV status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC, who were treated by primary RCTx. The study also supports that the individual tumour volumes should generally be included in biomarker studies and that panels of biomarkers are superior to individual parameters.

AB  - Screening programs for cervical cancer and breast cancer lead to a clear reduction of mortality. Starting in 2018 screening for cervical cancer will be structured as an organized program as already exists for breast cancer. In future screening for cervical cancer will be primarily performed by human papillomavirus (HPV) testing at intervals of 5 years while cytological examination (Pap smear) will also be available as an additional or alternative procedure. For breast cancer screening in Germany an annual clinical examination with palpation and mammography screening at 2-year intervals is provided for women aged between 50 and 69 years. In Germany only approximately 50 % of invited women have used the opportunity to participate in screening in recent years. Weighing the benefits against the harms of cancer screening programs is always important in the process of evaluation of different strategies.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and p16/Ki-67 staining for detecting cervical intraepithelial grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and CIN3 in women referred to colposcopy with minor abnormal cervical cytology low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and atypical squamous cells of undermined significance (ASC-US). The clinical performance of both tests was evaluated as stand-alone tests and combined, for detection CIN2+ and CIN3 over 2 years. METHODS: ThinPrep((R)) liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens were collected from 1349 women with repeat LSIL or ASC-US. HPV DNA was performed using Hybrid Capture. Where adequate material remained (n = 471), p16/Ki-67 overexpression was assessed. Clinical performance for detection of histologically diagnosed CIN2+ and CIN3 was calculated. RESULTS: Approximately 62.2% of the population were positive for HPV DNA, and 30.4% were positive for p16/Ki-67. p16/Ki-67 showed no significant difference in positivity between LSIL and ASC-US referrals (34.3% versus 28.6%; P = 0.189). Women under 30 years had a higher rate of p16/Ki-67 compared to those over 30 years (36.0% versus 26.6%; P = 0.029). Overall HPV DNA testing produced a high sensitivity for detection of CIN3 of 95.8% compared to 79.2% for p16/Ki-67. In contrast, p16/Ki-67 expression offered a higher specificity, 75.2% versus 40.4% for detection of CIN3. Combining p16/Ki-67 with HPV DNA improved the accuracy in distinguishing between CIN3 and <CIN3. The absolute risk of CIN3 increased from 15.6% in women who were HPV DNA positive to 27% in women positive for HPV DNA and p16/Ki-67. Those negative for HPV DNA and p16/Ki-67 had a low risk of 1.2% of CIN3. CONCLUSION: The addition of p16/Ki-67 to HPV DNA testing leads to a more accurate stratification of CIN in women presenting with minor cytological abnormalities.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare HPV16 detection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in relation to the quantity and quality of DNA isolated from 21 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) head and neck cancer tissues by three commercially available kits: EX-WAX DNA Extraction Kit (M) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), QIAamp((R)) DNA FFPE Tissue (Q) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and ReliaPrep FFPE gDNA Miniprep System (P) (Promega, Madison, USA). Quantity of extracted DNA was assessed spectrophometrically and fluorometrically. Its quality was analyzed using A260/280 and A260/230 ratios and the beta-actin fragment amplifiability in qPCR. HPV16 presence was detected by qPCR, using specific primers and TaqMan probe. HPV infection was found in 8 DNA samples extracted with M kit (38.1%) and in 7 (33.3%) isolated with Q and P kits. Three samples from M and Q kits were characterized by HPV16 positivity and lack of beta-actin amplifiability. They had significantly lower A260/280 ratio (M: 1.6+/-0.0, p=0.044 and Q: 1.7+/-0.0, p=0.016) compared to samples with both fragments amplification (M: 1.7+/-0.0 and Q: 1.9+/-0.0). Therefore, for HPV detection by qPCR in FFPE tissues we recommend ReliaPrep FFPE gDNA Miniprep System.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus DNA detection in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has been linked to improved patient prognosis. The main aims of the study was to test the hypotheses that HPV16 E6/E7 oncogene and p53 function within tumours were associated with the widely reported improved patient survival and prognosis in head and neck cancer. METHODS: HPV16 DNA, mRNA and p53 mRNA presence were analysed in a prospective study of 42 unselected HNSCC patients; correlating the data with patient age, tumour staging/grade, treatment response, disease recurrence and survival. RESULTS: HPV16 DNA and HPV16 mRNA were present in 45.2 % and 21.4 % of patients, respectively. There was a significant positive association between the detection of HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA and p53 mRNA (p = 0.032), but this was not replicated for HPV16 DNA. Five-year disease free survival for the whole cohort was 63 % (CI 52.5-73.5 %). Multivariable analysis revealed only HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA expression to have significant prognostic influence (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that HPV16 oncogenic transcriptional activity within HNSCC tumours is associated with improved patient survival and better prognosis in a German population. Simple HPV DNA detection alone did not demonstrate this association. The significant association of full-length (wild-type) p53 with HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA is further evidence for a functional relationship, which could contribute to the widely reported improved survival and prognosis. Larger studies are required to validate the frequency of HPV16 mRNA expression in HNSCC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is a pre-malignant lesion, potentially leading to vaginal cancer. It is a rare disease, representing less than 1% of all intraepithelial neoplasia of the female genital tract. Similar to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), there are three different grades of VAIN. VAIN 1 is also known as a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), whereas VAIN 2 and VAIN 3 both represent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Risk factors for the development of VAIN are similar to those for cervical neoplasia, i.e. promiscuity, starting sexual activity at an early age, tobacco consumption and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). However, compared to other intraepithelial neoplasia such as CIN or VIN (vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia), there still is little understanding about the natural course of VAIN and its capacity for pro- or regression. Furthermore, there is controversial data about the HPV detection rate in VAIN lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 67 patients with histologically confirmed VAIN, who were diagnosed between 2003 and 2011 at the University Women s Hospital of Heidelberg Germany, were included in this study. The biopsies of all participating patients were subjected to HPV genotyping. GP-E6/E7 Nested Multiplex PCR (NMPCR) was used to identify and genotype HPV. Eighteen pairs of type-specific nested PCR primers were assessed to detect the following "high-risk" HPV genotypes: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68, as well as the "low-risk" genotypes 6/11, 42, 43 and 44. The data was analyzed with the software SAS (Statistical Analysis System). RESULTS: All 67 cases were eligible for DNA analysis. The median age was 53 years. The largest group with 53% (n = 36) was formed by women, who were first diagnosed with VAIN between the age of 41 to 60 years. 50% (n = 37) of the patients presented a VAIN in the upper 1/3 of the vagina. 58 (87%) were diagnosed with HSIL (VAIN). The median age in patients with LSIL (VAIN) was 53 years and in patients with HSIL (VAIN) 53.5 years. 12 women (18%) had an immunosuppression. HPV positivity was confirmed in 37 patients (55%). Except for a single patient, who had a triple infection with HPV types 6/11, 16 and 68, only infections with one single HPV genotype were detected. An infection with the HPV genotypes 31, 39, 45, 51, 58, 59, 66, 42, 43 and 44 couldn't be found in any of the patients. In 28 patients with diagnosed VAIN, an infection with HPV 16 could be shown, 24 (86%) of them were diagnosed with a HSIL (VAIN). 16 (24%) women presented condylomata and 13 of them (81%) had a positive HPV status. However, only 47% of the women without condylomata presented a positive HPV status, resulting in a significant correlation (p = 0.0164) between condylomata and HPV infection. In 28 of all 67 patients (42%), recurrence of the neoplasia occurred. CONCLUSION: HPV 16 is the main virus-type to be associated with the development of a VAIN. Also, HPV 16 infection, VIN or condylomata acuminata in the past medical history seemed to be significant factors for early relapse.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPV DNA-based screening is more effective than a Pap test in preventing cervical cancer, but the test is less specific. New HPV tests have been proposed for primary screening. The HPV mRNA test showed a similar or slightly lower sensitivity than the HPV DNA tests but with a higher specificity. We report the results of an organised HPV mRNA-based screening pilot program in Venice, Italy. METHODS: From October 2011 to May 2014, women aged 25-64 years were invited to undergo a HPV mRNA test (Aptima). Those testing positive underwent cytological triage. Women with positive cytology were referred to colposcopy, whereas those with negative cytology were referred to repeat the HPV mRNA test 1 year later. The results of the HPV mRNA test program were compared with both the local historical cytology-based program and with four neighbouring DNA HPV-based pilot projects. RESULTS: Overall, 23 211 women underwent a HPV mRNA test. The age-standardised positivity rate was 7.0%, higher than in HPV DNA programs (6.8%; relative rate (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.17). The total colposcopy referral was 5.1%, double than with cytology (2.6%; RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.82-2.25) but similar to the HPV DNA programs (4.8%; RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.96-1.08). The cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ detection rate with HPV mRNA was greater than in the HPV DNA programs at baseline (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.19-1.88) and not significantly lower at the 1-year repeat (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.40-1.16). The overall RR was 1.29 (95% CI 1.05-1.59), which was much higher than with cytology (detection rate 5.5 per thousand vs 2.1 per thousand; RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.76-3.62). CONCLUSIONS: A screening programme based on the HPV mRNA obtained results similar to those observed with the HPV DNA test. In routine screening programmes, even a limited increase in HPV prevalence may conceal the advantage represented by the higher specificity of HPV mRNA.

AB  - We examined the prognostic value of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) after surgery and postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. FFPE-tissue originating from the surgery of 161 patients treated in 8 DKTK partner sites was immunohistochemically stained for CD3 and CD8. Their expression was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastases free-survival (DMFS), also in the context of the HPV16-DNA/p16 status. After a median follow-up of 48 months (range: 4100 months), OS at 4 years was 46.5% for the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis, high CD8 expression was confirmed as an independent prognostic parameter for OS (p = 0.002), LPFS (p = 0.004) and DMFS (p = 0.006), while CD3 expression lacked significance. In multivariate analysis HPV16 DNA positivity was associated with improved OS (p = 0.025) and LPFS (p = 0.013) and p16-positive patients showed improved DMFS (p = 0.008). Interestingly, high CD8 expression was a prognostic parameter for the clinical outcome in both HPV16 DNA-positive and HPV16 DNA-negative patients. Similar findings were observed in the multivariate analysis for the combined HPV16 DNA/p16 status. Altogether, CD8+ TILs constitute an independent prognostic marker in SCCHN patients treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. These data indicate that CD8-positive TILs have antitumour activity and could be used for treatment stratification. Further validation of the prognostic value of CD8+ TILs as a biomarker and its role in the immune response in SCCHN patients after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is warranted and will be performed in the prospective DKTK-ROG study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We measured the accuracy of p16(INK4a)-Ki67 (CINtec PLUS, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and E6/E7mRNA (types 16/18/31/33/45 NucliSENS easyQ, bioMerieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands) as triage test, alone and combined with cytology. METHODS: Six thousand two hundred and seventy two women were recruited in a population-based screening using HPV DNA as primary test; 396 were positive and were tested for cytology and biomarkers. All tests were performed on the same sample. Cytology-positive women were referred to colposcopy; cytology-negative women were referred to one-year HPV re-testing. The endpoint was CIN2+ at baseline or follow up. RESULTS: Sensitivity was 77.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.3-86.7) and 53.2% (95%CI: 40.3-65.4) for cytology at atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and high-grade threshold, and 87.6% (95%CI:75.7-93.6), and 80.8% (95%CI: 67.6-89.8) for p16INK4a-Ki67, and E6/E7mRNA, respectively. Colposcopy referral was 36% (95%CI: 31.2-40.9) and 11.2% (95%CI: 7.8-14.1) for cytology at ASC-US and high-grade threshold, respectively, and 36.0% (95%CI: 29.9-29.6), and 47.5% (95%CI: 32.5-42.4) for p16(INK4a)-Ki67, and E6/E7mRNA, respectively. Strategies referring high-grade cytology or biomarker positive women to colposcopy reached sensitivity close to 100%, with modest increase in colposcopy referral. CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity of combined strategies probably allows longer intervals in HPV-positive, triage-negative women.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). METHODS: Medical records of 65 women with VAIN treated between 2005 and 2012 at the colposcopy clinic of a German university hospital were retrospectively evaluated for VAIN grade, HPV status, VAIN localization, treatment method and relapse rate. Follow-up data were available for 53 patients (82 %). RESULTS: Mean age was 61 years (range 32-89 years). Most lesions (55 %) were found in the upper vaginal third; 42 % were multifocal. Multifocal VAIN was more frequently HPV positive than single lesions (p = 0.059). Of all women with known HPV status, 83 % were high-risk (HR) HPV positive and 32 % had a simultaneous CIN earlier or at the same time as the VAIN, mostly CIN 3 (66 %). Two-thirds had a hysterectomy in the past, often because of high-grade CIN. Most cases of VAIN were treated with CO2 laser vaporization. A relapse of the disease could be confirmed for 57 %. HR-HPV positive VAIN was significantly more likely to relapse than HR-HPV negative VAIN (p = 0.005). There were three cases of vaginal cancer with surrounding VAIN 3 or vaginal cancer diagnosed after primary treatment of VAIN 3 and one case of vaginal cancer during follow-up 22 months after the first laser vaporization. All of these cases were HR-HPV positive. CONCLUSIONS: VAIN has a high relapse rate and a high progression rate to invasive cancer especially if HR-HPV positive. Therefore, adequate follow-up examinations are mandatory.

AB  - Purpose/Objective(s): The causal relationship between cancer of the cervix uteri and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been adequately studied. There are also indications that there is a link between HPV infection and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The aim of this study was to find out the incidence and clinical outcome of HPV infection in head neck cancer patients in a German population. Materials/Methods: : In a retrospective study, the tumor tissue from 164 patients (110 men, 54 women, 62.8 years + 12.7) with head neck cancer (oropharynx = 65 nasopharynx = 10, larynx = 13, hypopharynx = 15, oral cavity = 33 CUP = 5, Other = 23) were tested for HPV infection and the clinical outcome was investigated. p16 as a surrogate marker for HPV infection was determined. Moreover, risk factors such as nicotine, alcohol abuse, resection margin of the tumor tissue, histology, lymph nodes involvement, extracapsular spread, tumor stage, and the treatment of the tumor were analyzed for local control and overall survival. Result(s): The incidence of HPV infection in oropharynx-carcinoma patients was 33%. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas showed a tendency towards longer survival time, (P = 0.76, HR: 2.42, 95% CI 0.91 - 6.44) compared to HPV-negative tumors. All other parameters were except the tumor stage in the uni and multivariate analysis not significant for local control and overall survival. The reason for this might be the small number of cases in our individual subgroups. Conclusion(s): The HPV infection in Germany was lower than expected. Also in our investigation it appears that HPV positive patients have a better clinical outcome than HPV negative patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) induce condylomata, anogenital cancers and their precursor lesions as anal or penile intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN/PIN). HIV-positive individuals have an increased risk for the development of anogenital HPV-induced lesions. OBJECTIVE: Estimation of the prevalence of HPV-related anogenital benign and malignant lesions in HIV-infected men attending a screening programme. METHODS: Four hundred HIV-positive men [98% men who have sex with men (MSM)] were enrolled in this prospective study from 2008 to 2011. All patients received an inspection of the anogenital region, digital rectal examination, high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), anal cytology, anal/penile histology if required, and HPV-typing of anal and penile swabs. RESULTS: At baseline, 75% (n = 302) of the men had abnormal anal cytological/histological results. 41% presented with low-grade (n = 164), 24% with high-grade anal dysplasia (n = 95) and two men with invasive anal cancer. 2.3% had PIN (n = 9) and one patient had penile cancer at baseline. Throughout the study period, 75% had anal dysplasia (low-grade n = 177, high-grade n = 125), 3.3% (n = 13) had PIN and two further patients developed anal cancer. Within the study period, 52.8% (n = 211) had condylomata (49% anal, 15% penile, 11% anal plus penile condylomata). At baseline, 88.5% of anal and 39.3% of penile swabs were HPV-DNA positive, and 77.8% of anal and 26.5% of penile swabs carried high-risk HPV-types. HPV16 was the most frequent HPV-type. CONCLUSION: HIV-positive MSM have a high risk for HPV-induced condylomata, (pre)malignant anogenital lesions and anogenital cancers. Screening for HPV-induced dysplasia is crucial to avoid progression to invasive carcinomas. Additionally, HPV-vaccination recommendations should be extended to high-risk populations.

AB  - Background: The causal relationship between cancer of the cervix uteri and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been adequately studied. There are also indications that there is link between HPV infection and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The aim of this study was to find out the incidence and clinical outcome of HPV infection in head neck cancer patients in a German population. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective study, the tumour tissue from 164 patients (110 men, 54 women, 62.8 years + 12.7) with head neck cancer (oropharynx = 65 nasopharynx = 10, larynx = 13, hypopharynx = 15, oral cavity = 33 CUP = 5, Other = 22) were tested for HPV infection and the clinical outcome was investigated. p16 as a surrogate marker for HPV infection was determined. Moreover, risk factors such as nicotine, alcohol abuse, resection margin of the tumour tissue, histology, lymph nodes involvement, extracapsular spread, tumour stage, and the treatment of the tumour were analysed for local control and overall survival. Result(s): The incidence of HPV infection in oropharynx-carcinoma patients was 33%. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas showed a tendency towards longer survival time, (p = 0.76, HR: 2.42, 95% CI 0.91 - 6.44) compared to HPV-negative tumours. All other parameters were except the tumour stage in the uni and multivariate analysis not significant for local control and overall survival. The reason for this might be the small number of cases in our individual subgroups. Conclusion(s): The HPV infection in Germany was lower than expected. Also in our investigation it appears that HPV positive patients have a better clinical outcome than HPV negative patients. Vaccination is important to reduce chronic inflammation and cancer.

AB  - Objectives: A subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers (OSCC) is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated. Co-prevalence of cervical and oropharyngeal HPV infection, ways of transmission, and adequate testing methods are still unknown. Method(s): Women with abnormal Pap smear admitted to the colposcopy unit University Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and Medical Center Asklepios Altona received HPV-testing of the uterine cervix and the oropharynx via tonsillar brush, in the cohort from the UKE additional oral lavage was performed. Greiner bio-one (GBO) - PapilloCheck HPV-PCR was used to differentiate 24 HPV types. Result(s): 235 women have been included in the study. 130/235 (55.3%) were cervically high risk HPV positive with histologically verified CIN II-III (median age 30, range 21-45 years). 7/130 (5.4.%) were oropharyngeally HPV positive. In 3/7 (4.3%) the same HPV types were detected cervically and orally. Tonsillar brush was HPV positive in 6/7 (85.7%) and oral HPV lavage in 2/7 (14.3%) patients. Only 2/130 (1.5%) cervically HPV positive women were also HPV positive in the oropharyngeal lavage (HPV 16 / high risk positive). 6/130 (4.6%) cervically HPV positive women were tonsillar brush positive. In only one case the same HPV types were found in lavage and tonsillar brush test (HPV 16, cervically HPV type 51). Conclusion(s): Oral HPV-prevalence in women with cervical HPV infection is very low. Simultaneous testing of oropharyngeal HPV infection in patients with cervical HPV related disease does not seem promising for screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) testing is already part of cervical cancer screening programs in a number of countries. New tests need to be validated not only in clinical studies but also in routine screening settings with regard to their clinical performance. METHODS: The Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV Test (RT hrHPV test) was evaluated in a random sample of 1,456 patients from a German routine screening population of 13,372 women >/=30 years of age screened primarily by liquid-based cytology (LBC) that was complemented by 48 CIN3+ cases. Clinical sensitivities, relative specificities and positive predictive values (PPV) for both HPV tests were determined based on histologically confirmed high-grade cervical disease (CIN3+) as clinical outcome. RESULTS: HR HPV prevalence in residual LBC samples was found to be 5.4 % by the RT hrHPV test and 5.6 % by the HR HC2 test, respectively. The Kappa-value for overall agreement between the RT hrHPV test and the HC2 assay for detection of HR HPV was 0.87. Relative sensitivities for detection of CIN3+ in patients with abnormal cytology was 93.8 % for the RT hrHPV assay and 97.9 % for HC2 (p-value = 0.5). Relative specificities and PPVs were comparable for both tests. The highest PPV was calculated for the specific detection of HPV16 by the RT hrHPV test (84.2 %). The RT hrHPV test showed a reduced sensitivity for detection of HVP31-positive CIN3 + . CONCLUSION: The RT hrHPV assay is as sensitive and specific in detecting severe cervical lesions in women with abnormal cytology as the HC2 HR HPV test.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: (18)F-FDG PET/CT is widely used in clinical oncology. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) represents an emerging disease that differs from HPV-negative OPSCC in clinical behavior and tumour biology. In these tumours, HPV-oncogenes might lead to distinct alterations in metabolic pathways. Therefore, we compared metabolic parameters using (18)F-FDG PET/CT in HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC in relation to histopathological findings. MATERIALS: Eighty-six patients with OPSCC received pre-therapeutic (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Standardised uptake volume (SUV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and metabolic tumour volume (MTV) were analysed for the primary tumour. SUVmax was determined for neck lymph nodes. HPV-status was determined; overall survival rates (OS) were estimated. RESULTS: 32/86 patients (37.2%) had HPV-related OPSCC. Overall, PET-parameters in primary tumours of both groups did not differ significantly. Comparing early with locally advanced primary tumours, there was a significant increase in (18)F-FDG uptake in HPV-negative patients (p<0.001). Positive nodes of HPV-related OPSCC showed significantly higher SUVmax values (p=0.039) compared to HPV-negative OPSCC. Strikingly, there was a higher intraindividual homogeneity of (18)F-FDG uptake between primary and respective positive nodes in HPV-related primary OPSCC (p=0.001). SUV-max and -mean values did not correlate with OS in HPV-related OPSCC. CONCLUSION: The intraindividual homogeneity of 18F-FDG uptake in HPV-related OPSCC could reflect the more homogenously, HPV-triggered carcinogenesis compared to the mutation-driven carcinogenesis in the HPV-negative OPSCC with heterogenic (18)F-FDG uptake.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore prognostic and predictive value of radiomics in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (LAHNSCC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or bioradiotherapy (BRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 120 patients (CRT vs. BRT matched 2:1) were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 544 radiomics features of the primary tumor were extracted from radiotherapy planning computed tomography scans. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between survival and radiomics features with false discovery rate correction. The discriminatory performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed a 24-feature based signature significantly predicted for OS (HR=0.3, P=0.02) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR=0.3, P=0.01). Combining the radiomics signature with p16 status showed a significant improvement of prognostic performance compared with p16 (AUC=0.78vs. AUC=0.64 at 5years, P=0.01) or radiomics signature (AUC=0.78vs. AUC=0.67, P=0.01) alone. When patients were stratified according to this combination, OS and PFS were significantly different according to the 4 sub-types (p16+ with low/high signature score; p16- with low/high signature score) (P<0.001). Patients with high signature score significantly benefited from CRT (vs. BRT) in terms of OS (P=0.004), while no benefit from CRT in patients with low signature score. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests an added value of radiomics features as prognostic and predictive biomarker in HNSCC treated with CRT/BRT. Moreover, the radiomics signature provided additional information to HPV/p16 status to further stratify patients. External validation of such findings is mandatory given the risk of overfitting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalized medicine and treatment stratification of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) today mostly ignore genetic heterogeneity in HNSCC but especially the patient's genetic background. We hypothesized that particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (HLA-A, B, Cw) and II proteins (DR, DQ) confer susceptibility for and influence development of HNSCC and may be prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS). METHODS: 90 consecutive HNSCC patients of the prospective observational cohort study LIFE treated between 08/2010 and 05/2011 at the University Leipzig underwent low resolution typing of HLA-A, B, Cw, DR, and DQ. Antigen and haplotype frequencies were compared to those in German blood donors. Effects on PFS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. RESULTS: HNSCC patients had overall altered HLA-B frequencies (P<0.05); frequencies of B *44 were lower, those of B *13, B *52, and B *57 increased (P<0.05). Almost all other antigen frequencies showed no deviation. Homozygous HLA-Cw and DRB4 were frequent and associated with reduced PFS (P<0.05). Altered haplotype frequencies were common and particular haplotypes accompanied by differing PFS. B *13/Cw *06 carriers had poorest outcome (P=0.011). However, multivariate Cox proportional hazard models revealed 3 clinical covariates (localization oropharynx, loco-regional metastasis, and T4 category), HPV16-DNA positivity, and 10 HLA traits as independent predictors for PFS. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of the genetic background of HNSCC patients calls for future research to clarify the role of HLA traits in HNSCC and if PFS depends on HLA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the characteristics of high-risk papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in men. The aims of this cross-sectional study were: (a) to investigate HR-HPV prevalence and genotype distribution in men, sexual partners of women presenting with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-CIN), according to epidemiological characteristics, and (b) to assess type-specific concordance between partners. METHODS: A total of 125 men were recruited within the first 6 months after HG-CIN diagnosis of their partner. Samples from the coronal sulcus, glans penis shaft, and scrotum were tested with linear array HPV genotyping assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Type-specific concordance within 120 couples was studied. Epidemiological factors were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. SPSS 19 (IBM, Chicago, USA). RESULTS: The prevalence of HR-HPV infection in males was 50.4% (63/125). HPV16/53/52/51/66/31 were the most frequent genotypes (24/10.4/9.6/8.8/8/7.2%, respectively). Current smoking was associated with an increased risk for HR-HPV infection in men (38.2% (21/55) vs 60% (42/70), OR 2.4, p=0.025). Among 60 infected couples, 62% shared at least one genotype: 41.7% couples were concordantly HPV16 positive and 18.3% were HPV16 negative (kappa value: 0.21). The proportion of women with the same genotype as their male partner was higher than the proportion of men sharing the same genotype as their female partner: 58.7% (37/63) vs 30.8% (37/120), p<0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual partners of women with HG-CIN are a significant reservoir and vector of HPV infection, a fact that could contribute to making viral clearance more difficult to achieve in their partners after treatment of their HG-CIN lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines have been widely implemented in worldwide organized immunization programs. A nonavalent HPV vaccine is now available in several countries. The objective was to describe the fraction of squamous non-invasive high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions attributable to genotypes targeted by bi-quadrivalent vaccines and by nonavalent vaccine according to age and diagnosis in women living in the city of Vigo (Galicia, Spain). METHODS: Cervical scrapings (2009-2014) of women with histological diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2, n = 145) and grade 3-carcinoma in situ (CIN3-CIS, n = 244) were tested with Linear Array HPV Genotyping test (Roche diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Hierarchical estimation of the fraction attributable to HPV 16/18 or HPV 31/33/45/52/58 detected alone or in combination was calculated. Absolute additional fraction attributable to genotypes targeted by nonavalent vaccine compared to genotypes targeted by bi-quadrivalent vaccines was calculated as the increment of attributable cases with respect to all studied cases. Age group 1, 2 and 3 included women 18 to 34, 35-44 and >/=45 years old, respectively. EPIDAT 3.1 was used. RESULTS: Fraction attributable to genotypes targeted by bi-quadrivalent vaccines was 59% CIN2 vs. 69% CIN3-CIS (p < 0.001). It was 63/51/50% of CIN2 and 78/66/45% of CIN3-CIS in age group 1, 2, 3, respectively. Fraction attributable to genotypes targeted by nonavalent vaccine was 86% CIN2 and 86% CIN3-CIS. It was 87/91/75% of CIN2 and 90/86/76% of CIN3-CIS in age group 1, 2, 3, respectively. Fraction attributable to genotypes targeted by these vaccines tended to decrease as age increased (p-trend <0.05). Globally, absolute additional attributable fraction was 16%, 26% and 29% in age group 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Absolute additional fraction of CIN2 and CIN3-CIS attributable to genotypes targeted by nonavalent vaccine was observed in women of any age, especially in those over 35 years old.

AB  - We examined the prognostic role of PD-1+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and PD-L1+ cells in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with surgery and postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). FFPE samples from 161 patients were immunohistochemically stained for PD-1, CD8 and PD-L1. The immune marker expression was correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics, and overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastases free-survival (DMFS), also in the context of HPV16 DNA/p16 status. The median follow-up was 48 months (range: 4-100). The 2-year-OS was 84.1% for the entire cohort. High PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were more common in patients with positive HPV16 DNA (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively) and high infiltration by CD8+ TILs (p < 0.001 for both markers). High PD-L1 expression correlated with superior OS (p = 0.025), LPFS (p = 0.047) and DMFS (p = 0.048) in multivariable analysis, whereas no significance could be demonstrated for PD-1. Patients with CD8(high) /PD-L1(high) expression had favorable outcome (p < 0.001 for all endpoints) compared to other groups. We validated the superior OS data on CD8(high) /PD-L1(high) using the Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA dataset (n = 518; p = 0.032). High PD-L1 expression was a favorable prognostic marker in HPV16-negative but not HPV16-positive patients. In conclusion, HPV-positive tumors showed higher expression of immune markers. PD-L1 expression constitutes an independent prognostic marker in SCCHN patients post-adjuvant CRT. In conjunction with CD8 status, these data provide an important insight on the immune contexture of SCCHN and are directly relevant for future treatment stratification with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors to complement CRT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of cervical cytology and high-risk HPV tests using samples obtained using two different collection modalities in a population of Brazilian women: self-collection (vaginal lavage) and cervical Pap testing. METHODS: We enrolled 204 women who were aged 18-64 years and had previously obtained abnormal cervical cytology test results; 83.8% of them agreed to participate. The sample was divided into two aliquots: one for the cytological study and one for the molecular analysis of high-risk HPV. RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of the participants preferred to utilize self-collection as an alternative screening method. However, we noticed that the HPV positivity rate was significantly lower in self-collected samples when compared to those obtained using the conventional collection method (p = 0.035). The cytology tests of the samples obtained via self-collection were sensitive and had a positive predictive value and an area under the curve (AUC) that were significantly lower than those of the Pap test. However, the specificity and negative predictive value of these tests were similar. When compared with the HPV test, the self-collected samples demonstrated lower accuracy in predicting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse, with a significantly lower sensitivity, positive predictive value, and AUC than the cervical Pap test samples. CONCLUSION: Self-collection by vaginal lavage is simple and well accepted by women. Due to its limitations, however, self-collection by lavage should be utilized with caution.

AB  - Introduction: Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) represent the majority of malignant penile tumours. About 50% of all SCCs are associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV). The value of HPV in terms of prognosis is controversially discussed. The aim of this international multicentre study is the evaluation of histopathologic and prognostic parameters in correlation to HPV in penile SCC. Method(s): We included 123 patients from Russia and Germany. The tumours have been classified according to the novel 2016 WHO classification. HPV genotyping was performed and immunohistochemical staining of p16 and p53 is in progress. Clinical data were correlated to the histological subtype and HPV status. Result(s): HPV was detected in 54% of all tumours; HPV16 was the most frequent type (90%). We observed a clear distribution of HPV in the respective novel subtypes. 47% of the N- and 67% of the N+ patients exhibit high risk HPV. Exclusively high risk HPV was found in lymph node metastasis and the HPV type of the primary tumour equals to the corresponding metastasis. In general, only a tendency of longer cancer specific survival (CSS) was observed in patients with high risk HPV compared to HPV negative tumours. However, CSS was different depending on histological subtype, whereby the worst outcome was observed in HPV-related basaloid carcinomas. In the usual type HPV positive tumours reveal a higher CSS than HPV negative whereby no HPV positive N+ patient died. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that the histological subtype determines the prognosis of the disease. HPV is not a general prognostic factor. Therefore, clinical and molecular studies have to be performed considering the histopathological subtype in combination with HPV rather than HPV-status alone independent on histological type.

AB  - Purpose or Objective Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is a well-defined disease typically affecting young to middle-aged male nonsmokers. The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers is rapidly increasing in most Western countries, but detailed epidemiological data are not available for the Dusseldorf population. Moreover, among other head and neck regions, a less significant proportion of oral highgrade dysplasia and cancers appears to depend on HPV infection, whereas its role in laryngeal cancer is recognized as less significant. The aim of this study was to find out the incidence and clinical outcome of HPV infection in different head neck cancer patients in a German population. Material and Methods In this retrospective study, the tumour tissue from 164 patients (110 men, 54 women, 62.8 years + 12.7) with head neck cancer (oropharynx = 65 nasopharynx = 10, larynx = 13, hypopharynx = 15, oral cavity = 33 CUP = 5, Other = 23) were tested for HPV infection. Furthermore, the clinical outcome for all tumor sides was examined with uni and multivariate analysis. We analyzed p16 in all tumor tissues as a surrogate marker for HPV infection with immunohistochemistry. Moreover, risk factors such as nicotine, alcohol abuse, location of the tumour, resection margin of the tumour tissue, histology, lymph nodes involvement, extracapsular spread, tumour stage, and the treatment of the tumour (surgery, chemo and radiation therapy) were examined for local tumour control and overall survival for all patients. Results The prevalence of HPV infection in oropharynx-carcinoma patients in Dusseldorf was 33%. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas showed a tendency towards longer survival time, (p = 0.76, HR: 2.42, 95% CI 0.91 - 6.44) compared to HPV-negative tumours. This association was independent from alcohol and nicotine abuse. Other tumour locations like larynx or hypopharynx carcinoma showed no association between HPV infection and clinical outcome. As expected the tumour stage in all tumour locations was significant in the uni and multivariate analysis for local control and overall survival. Conclusion The HPV infection in Dusseldorf was lower than anticipated. Furthermore, in our study it seems that p 16 positive oropharyngeal carcinoma patients have a better clinical outcome than p 16 negative patients. In this patient group p 16 can be used as a prognostic biomarker. This was independent from alcohol and nicotine abuse. But for other tumor localizations we could not find a better clinical outcome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Squamous cell carcinomas of the penis represent the majority of malignant penile tumours. Metastasis is the most important prognostic factor, but less is known about tumourigenesis and progression. About 50% of all SCCs are associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV). Therefore, the WHO published a novel HPV-based classification of penile tumours. The aim of this international multicentre study is the evaluation of histopathologic and prognostic parameters in correlation to HPV in penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). MATERIAL & METHODS: We collected data and tumor samples from 172 patients from Russia and Germany. The tumours have been classified considering the new 2016 WHO classification. DNA was isolated from FFPE tissues and the HPV genotyping was performed by qPCR and sequencing. Clinical and histopathological data were correlated to HPV. RESULT(S): HPV was detected in 51 % of available tumour samples. HPV 16 represented the most frequent subtype (87%). We observed a clear distribution of HPV in the respective novel subtypes. The HPV-related subtypes Clear cell carcinoma (100%), Papillary-basaliod (100%), Warty-basaliod (100%), Basaliod (88%) and Warty (67%) were predominantly high risk HPV positive. In addition, the non-HPVrelated subtype Squamous cell carcinoma (usual type) exhibited high risk HPV in 23%. HPV infection varied with age: <50 years (57%), 51-70 years (40%), and >70 years (46%). In 44% of the N- and in 62% of the N+ patients as well as in 48% of patients with pT1-2 and in 28% with pT3-4 tumors high risk HPV occurred. Exclusively high risk HPV 16 and 18 was found in lymph node metastases and the HPV type of metastasis correlated with the HPV type of the corresponding primary tumor. A tendency of higher tumour specific survival rate was observed for patients with high risk HPV positive tumours. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate a distinct role of high risk HPV in penile SCC for development of specific histological subtypes, prognosis and tumourigenesis. To validate these results, we continuously expand our patient population and starting molecular analysis to explore the processes of tumourigenesis and metastasis dependent on HPV.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the main risk factors associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Although it is a prognostic factor, SCCHN patients are not routinely tested for HPV status because it may not be informative for therapy initiation. The objective of this study was to understand the real world testing patterns, and treatment decision of SCCHN patients. Method(s): Real world data was gathered using Adelphi's Disease-Specific Programme (DSP) - a real world, crosssectional survey conducted in the USA, France, Germany and the UK (April - September 2016). The DSP incorporated 182 physician interviews (54 US, 128 EU) covering all stages of SCCHN caseloads and treatment patterns. Physicians also provided data for 8 consecutive consulting SCCHN patients regarding treatment patterns, progression, and symptoms. Result(s): A total of 2193 SCCHN patient cases were captured. HPV testing was carried out in 42% of patients within the DSP data set with no particular difference across the 4 countries. Of those tested, 35% of patients were HPV positive. Testing was mainly performed at the local level (51%, onsite or local hospital) apart from Germany where central testing was higher (73%). In over half of patients cases (54%) , physicians are unaware of the type of test performed for the HPV status determination; in fact, up to 10 different types of tests were used to determine the HPV status in this real world experience. Platinum based cetuximab and fluorouracil was used in 30% of the HPV positive patients while 20% received platinum monotherapy. In 2nd line, docetaxel/paclitaxel monotherapy was used in 22% of the patients. HPV negative patients also mainly received platinum based cetuximab and fluorouracil (27%) in 1 line, while in 2 line, docetaxel/paclitaxel monotherapy was used in 20% of the patients. Conclusion(s): This analysis of real world treatment patterns and outcomes among SCCHN patients shows that HPV testing is not widely carried out for either patient characterization or to guide treatment decisions within this disease. Therapy choices were generally consistent standard clinical guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing plays a main role in the management of cervical cancer, however to improve the specificity in cervical screening, there is a need to develop and validate different approaches that can identify women at risk for progressive disease. Nowadays, mRNA expression of viral E6 and E7 HPV oncogenes stands up as a potential biomarker to improve cervical screening. We aimed to validate a method for RNA extraction, detect HPV mRNA expression and, assess the relationship between E6/E7 mRNA expression and pathology of patients' lesions and progression. METHODS: This study included 50 specimens that had been previously genotyped as HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and/or 45. Cervical swabs were extracted with three different RNA extraction methods -Nuclisens manual extraction kit (bioMerieux), High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) and RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen)-, and mRNA was detected with NucliSens EasyQ HPV version 1 test (bioMerieux) afterwards. Association of oncogene expression with pathology and lesion progression was analyzed for each extraction method. RESULTS: E6/E7 mRNA positivity rate was higher in samples analyzed with bioMerieux (62%), followed by Roche (24%) and Qiagen (6%). Women with lesions and lesion progression showed a higher prevalence of viral RNA expression than women that had not lesions or with lesion persistence. While bioMerieux revealed a higher sensitivity (77.27%), Roche presented a higher PPV (75%) and an increased specificity (89.28%). CONCLUSIONS: Extraction methods based on magnetic beads provided better RNA yield than those based in columns. Both Nuclisens manual extraction kit (bioMerieux) and High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) seemed to be adequate for E6/E7 mRNA detection. However, none of them revealed both high sensitivity and specificity values. Further studies are needed to obtain and validate a standard gold method for RNA expression detection, to be included as part of the routine cervical screening program.

AB  - Patients with neck squamous cell carcinomas of unknown primary tumour (NSCCUP) present with lymph node metastasis without evidence for a primary tumour. Most patients undergo an aggressive multimodal treatment, which induces severe, potentially unnecessary toxicity. Primary tumours of NSCCUP can be hidden in the oropharynx. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally involved in a subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) associated with early lymph node metastasis and good prognosis. Detection of markers for HPV transformation in NSCCUP could allow focussing on the oropharynx in primary tumour search and could be of value for choice and extent of treatment. In a retrospective multicentre study (Germany, Italy and Spain), we analysed metastatic lymph nodes from 180 NSCCUP patients for the presence of HPV DNA, HPV E6*I mRNA and cellular p16(INK4a) overexpression, a surrogate marker for HPV-induced transformation. HPV status, defined as positivity for viral mRNA with at least one additional marker, was correlated with clinical parameters and survival outcome. A substantial proportion (16%) of NSCCUP were HPV-driven, mainly by HPV16 (89%). HPV prevalence increased with year of diagnosis from 9% during 1998-2004 to 23% during 2005-2014 (p = 0.007). HPV-driven NSCCUP had significantly better overall and progression-free survival rates (p </= 0.008). Based on this survival benefit, it is contended that HPV RNA status should be included in NSCCUP diagnosis and in therapeutic decision-making. Deintensification of radiation in patients with HPV-driven NSCCUP, while concurrently concentrating on the oropharynx appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy, the efficacy of which should be assessed in prospective trials. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on HPV in NSCCUP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A change of cervical cancer screening algorithms to an HPV-based screening setting is discussed in many countries, due to higher sensitivity of HPV testing compared to cytology. Reliable triage methods are, however, an essential prerequisite in such a setting to avoid overtreatment and higher screening costs. RESULTS: In this study, a series of cervical scrapes collected in PreservCyt liquid-based cytology (LBC) medium from women with cervical cancer (n = 5), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1-3 (n = 74), and normal cytology (n = 201; further n = 352 collected in SureThin(R)) were assessed for methylation of the marker regions ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, and ZNF671 using the GynTect assay and compared to cobas(R) HPV and CINtec Plus(R) biomarker results. All samples from women with cervical cancer, 61.2% of CIN3, 44.4% of CIN2 and 20.0% of CIN1 cases were scored positive for the GynTect methylation assay. In contrast, all CIN, irrespective of severity grade, and carcinomas were positive by both, CINtec Plus and cobas HPV. The specificity of GynTect for CIN3+ was 94.6% compared to 69.9% for CINtec Plus and 82.6% for cobas HPV (all HPV types) and 90.6% for cobas HPV 16/18. DNA methylation analysis of this methylation marker panel (GynTect assay) in cervical scrapes consistently detects cervical cancer and the majority of CIN3 as well as a subset of CIN1/2 lesions. The detection rate among cytologically normal samples is extraordinarily low (1.5%). CONCLUSION: GynTect shows excellent performance when using cervical scrape material collected in liquid-based cytology media, a prerequisite for employing such a test as a triage in screening programs. Compared to the other test systems used in this work, GynTect showed higher specificity while still detecting all cancer cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of safe and effective HPV vaccines in France, more than 80% of girls remain unvaccinated. SETTING: A regional university hospital referral center in France. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall prevalence and distribution of HPV in vaccinated, sexually active young French women who were screened for cervical cancer by cytology and HPV testing. METHODS: High-risk HPV (HR-HPV) prevalence, genotype-specific prevalence and extent of multiple infections were assessed in 125 cervical samples from females with available vaccine data using hc2 assay and INNO-LiPA assay. HPV status was analyzed in accordance with cytological data. RESULTS: In our series, mean age was 23 years, overall prevalence of HR-HPV was 52% and was correlated with the lesion grade. The diversity of HPV genotypes was broad. Single HR-HPV infections were identified in 11%, 21% and 47% of women with NILM, ASC-US/-H and LSIL respectively. Multiple infections with HR-HPV were detected in 28% of the specimens. Only 24.5% of women with NILM presented infections with 2 genotypes or more, vs 28% of women with ASC-US/-H and 35% of women with LSIL. The overall prevalence of genotypes covered by the quadrivalent vaccine was low (5.9%); with 4.2%, 0%, 0.8% and 0.8% for HPV 16, HPV 18, HPV 6 and HPV 11 respectively. CONCLUSION: Among HPV-vaccinated young women, HR-HPV are detected at a high rate, and an association with the grade of cytological abnormalities was observed. However, HPV 16 and 18, both targeted by the vaccines, are remarkably rare among young French women since program implementation.

AB  - Introduction: We have previously established an association of MAGE-/NY-ESO-1 expression and poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients (pt). There is some evidence that TAA differ between HPV-negative (HPV-) and HPV-positive (HPV+) patients. Antibodies (AB) to tumor-associated antigens (TAA) may help to characterize the TAA repertoire in the tumor. Method(s): AB to 29 auto-antigens and HPV-16 E6 were analyzed in serum and plasma samples of 410 HNSCC pt treated at different German cancer centers. As a surrogate marker, reactivity to HPV-16 E6 was used to define the HPV status. Statistical comparison of AB prevalence by HPV-status was performed using a Chi2 test corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli with a false discovery rate of 10%. Result(s): Among 410 pt, 126 (31%) were reactive to HPV-16 E6. The five most frequent AB were directed against HPV-16 E6 (31%), MAGE-A3 (13%), SpanXa1 (12%), MAGE-A4 (11%) and MAGE-A1 (10%). In HPV-negative pt, AB against MAGE-A3, MAGEA4, SpanXa1, LAGE-1a and NY-ESO-1 were detected in >=10% of pt, whereas in HPV-positive pt AB against SpanXa1, CT-47 Newsletter abonnleren und kostenloses Whitepaper slchernl and MAGE-A1 were found in >=10% of pt. Significant differences with regard to the prevalence of AB by HPV-status were detected for p53, MAGE-A3, -A4, -A9, LAGE-1a and NY-ESO-1 (p < 0.022). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of antigen-specific AB to TAA differed significantly by HPV-status. In the development of antigen-specific immunotherapy such as cancer vaccines, HPV status has to be acknowledged. Data analysis is ongoing.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the EUROArray HPV genotyping assay (Euroimmun) against the HPV 3.5 LCD-Array Kit (Chipron) from liquid based cervical cytology samples clinician collected from women undergoing cervical inspection at the dysplasia consultation. Method(s): DNA extracted from clinician-collected cervical brush specimens from 163 German women were evaluated by EUROarray HPV and HPV 3.5 LCD-Array Kit for detection of HR (high-risk)- and LR (low-risk)-HPV genotypes. Genotype-specific agreements were assessed by Cohen's kappa statistic and Fisher's z-test of significance between proportions. Result(s): Positivity for 17 HR-HPV types was 42.3% for EUROarray and 38.0% for HPV 3.5 LCD-Array. Agreement between the EUROarray and the HPV 3.5 LCD-Array for detection of HR-HPV was very good (kappa= 0.83). For detection of HR-HPV, agreement with EUROarray was 92.0%. Identical genotypes of HR-HPV were detected in 50 of 72 samples with any detected HR-HPV (81.9%, kappa= 0.47). EUROarray genotyping for HPV16 and/or 18 was highly concordant with Chipron (relative agreement 96.3%, kappa= 0.88). Conclusion(s): Detection of HR-HPV was not significantly different between EUROarray and HPV 3.5 LCD-Array. EUROarray was highly concordant with the HPV 3.5 LCD-Array evaluated for detection of high-risk HPV.

AB  - Objectives: Cancers of the head and neck (HN) are a diverse group of cancers originating in the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal chambers, and salivary glands. As treatments for HN cancers have evolved, the use of biomarker testing to appropriately identify the best treatment has become more important. The purpose of this analysis is to compare the rates of testing among HN patients on two key biomarker tests PD-L1 and HPV status in the US and 5 European (EU5) countries. Method(s): A retrospective medical chart review of patients with HN in the US (n= 606) and EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK; n= 1,000) was conducted between 7/2016 and 6/2017. Physicians randomly selected patient charts currently on an anti-cancer regimen and extracted data on patient demographics, disease status, treatment patterns, and biomarker status. Result(s): Of the 1,606 HN patients included in this analysis, the US and EU5 had different gender distributions (percent male US: 68%, EU: 81%, p= < 0.01), but similar average ages (mean (SD) US: 62.86 (8.25), EU: 63.32 (8.81) between groups (p= 0.29). When identifying PD-L1 status between the countries, significantly more patients in the EU5 had never been tested (76%, US: 61%, p= < 0.01). Of those who were tested in the US (n= 238) and EU5 (n= 244), 63% of patients in the US were positive compared to only 35% in the EU5 (p= < 0.01). HPV results showed no differences in the testing rate (US: 89%, EU5: 91%, p= 0.54), but of those tested (US: 535, EU5: 908) significantly more HN patients tested HPV positive in the US (26%) than in the EU5 (16%, p= < 0.01). Conclusion(s): As new advanced therapies become available the importance of biomarker testing among HN cancer patients will continue to grow. Understanding the differences in how tests are used as well as patient test results by region is vital in the development and testing process.

AB  - Background: Currently, there are two major pathways for tumorigenesis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) - an HPV-dependent with p16 overexpression as a surrogate for HPV-associated transformation and an HPV-independent route linked to lichen sclerosus, characterized by p53 mutation. A possible correlation of HPV dependency with a favourable prognosis has been proposed. Method(s): The AGO CaRE-1 study is a retrospective survey of pts with primary VSCC FIGO stage >1 B (UICC-TNM version 6) treated at 29 gynecologic cancer centers in Germany 1998-2008 (n = 1,618). For this CaRE-translational sub-study available FFPE tissue was collected centrally (n = 648). A tissue micro array (TMA) was constructed; p16 and p53 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HPV status and subtype were analyzed by PCR. Result(s): p16 IHC was interpretable in 550 TMA spots and considered positive in 166/550 (30.2%). HPV DNA was detected in 78.4% of the p16+ tumors, with HPV 16 being the most common subtype (88.3%).Pts with p16+ tumors were younger at diagnosis (63 vs. 70 yrs for p16- tumors; p = 0 < 0.01) and showed lower rates of lymph-node involvement (29.0% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.021). p53 IHC was interpretable in 597 spots, 187/597 (31.3%) were considered positive. Pts with p53+ tumors were older at first diagnosis (71 vs. 66 yrs; p = 0.001 for p53- tumors) and showed lymph-node involvement more often (43.3% vs. 31.1%; p = 0.007). There was a relevant number of tumors with neither p16 nor p53 overexpression (221/535); while co-expression of p53 and p16 was rare (12/535). For survival analyses, three groups were defined: p53+ (n = 163), p16+/p53- (n = 151) and p16-/p53- (n = 221). 2-y-disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly different between the groups: DFS: p53+ 47.0%; p16-/p53- 53% and p16+/p53- 65.5% (p < 0.001); OS: 70.4%, 72.6% and 82.7% (p = 0.003), respectively. Adjustment for age and nodal status showed consistent p16 and p53 effects regarding DFS. Conclusion(s): p16 overexpression is associated with an improved prognosis in VSCC while p53 positivity is linked to an adverse outcome. Our data provide evidence of a clinically relevant third subgroup of VSCC with a p53-/p16-phenotype showing an intermediate prognosis that needs to be further characterized.

AB  - Purpose/Objective(s): This multicenter retrospective biomarker trial aimed to develop a methylome-based classifier for stratification of patients at risk for loco-regional recurrence (LR) and all event progression in Human Papilloma Virus DNA negative (HPV-) Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with adjuvant Cis-Platin (CP) based Radiochemotherapy (RCHT) post-surgery. Materials/Methods: Methylome analysis was performed on FFPE material for three patient cohorts utilizing Illumina Human Methylation 450K (n=2) and 850K-EPIC (n=1) technology. The training set consisted of a homogeneous cohort treated with adjuvant CP+RCHT (total n=194, HPV- n=128) in frame of DKTK-ROG trial. Two retrospective German monocentric cohorts with HNSCC patients treated with adjuvant RCHT at Munich (n=79, HPV- n=53) and Dresden (n=91, HPV- n=72) were utilized for validation. Disease progression was defined as LR or distant metastasis (DM). A classifier model was developed in a stepwise selection of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) between tumors with (n=43) vs without (n=85) disease progression at FDR<0.05, followed by multivariate cox regression and a bootstrap Lasso. A Lasso cutoff score of >-0.32 separated patients with poor prognosis (n=88) vs good prognosis (n=40). To circumvent cutoff adjustment across different methylation platforms, the 38 probes identified by Lasso were used to train a binary random Forest (RF) model. The RF was subsequently used to predict patient outcome in the validation cohort (n=125). Result(s): Within the training cohort, bootstrap Lasso identified a 38-probes based model associated with progression in HPV- HNSCC. At a cutoff of -0.32, Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.98. The Out of Bag Error (OOB) for the RF was 14.8%. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed RF-predicted classes were associated with significant differences in progression, Overall Survival (OS), LR and DM (p<10-10) in the training cohort (n=128). RF-predicted classes remained significant on multivariate analysis adjusting for anatomical site, Extracapsular Extension (ECE) and T stage (HRs range 1.6-2.7, p<3x10-7). Within the validation cohort, RF predicted classes were significant for OS (p<0.01), Progression (p<0.02) and LR (p<0.01) by KM-analysis and on adjusted multivariate analysis (HRs range 1.8-2.53, p<0.03). Conclusion(s): A methylation-based RF model for risk stratification of HPV- HNSCC patients treated with post-surgical CP based RCHT is successfully developed and validated.Copyright © 2019

AB  - BACKGROUND: The indicating FTA card is a dry medium used for collection of cervical samples. HPVIR is a multiplex real-time PCR test that detects 12 high-risk human papillomavirus types (hrHPV) and provides single genotype information for HPV16, - 31, - 35, - 39, - 51, - 56, and - 59 and pooled type information for HPV18/45 and HPV33/52/58. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a strategy with cervical samples collected on the FTA card and subsequently analysed with the HPVIR test complies with the criteria of the international guidelines for a clinically validated method for cervical screening. METHODS: We performed a non-inferiority test comparing the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the candidate test (FTA card and HPVIR) with a clinically validated reference test (Cobas((R)) HPV test) based on liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples. Two clinical samples (LBC and FTA) were collected from 896 participants in population-based screening. For evaluation of the specificity we used 799 women without >/= CIN2, and for clinical sensitivity we used 67 women with histologically confirmed >/= CIN2. The reproducibility was studied by performing inter- and intra-laboratory tests of 558 additional clinical samples. RESULTS: The clinical sensitivity and specificity for samples collected on the FTA card and analysed using the HPVIR test were non-inferior to samples analysed with the Cobas(R) HPV test based on LBC samples (non-inferiority test score, p = 1.0 x 10(- 2) and p = 1.89 x 10(- 9), respectively). Adequate agreement of > 87% was seen in both the intra- and inter-laboratory comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Samples collected on the indicating FTA card and analysed with HPVIR test fulfil the requirements of the international guidelines and can therefore be used in primary cervical cancer screening.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To independently validate the impact of tumour volume, p16 status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures as potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who underwent primary radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy (RCTx). These markers have previously been reported in a study of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) (Linge et al., 2016). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective monocentric study, 92 patients with locally advanced HNSCC were included. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions and Cox models presented in the study of the DKTK-ROG were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) and the concordance index (ci), respectively. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional tumour control (LRC) after primary RCTx. RESULTS: Although both cohorts significantly differed in the proportion of the tumour subsites, the parameters tumour volume, p16 status and N stage could be validated regarding LRC and overall survival (OS) using multivariable Cox regression (LRC ci: 0.59, OS ci: 0.63). These models were slightly improved by combination with the putative CSC marker CD44 (LRC ci: 0.61, OS ci: 0.69). The logistic regression model for 2-year LRC based on tumour volume, p16 status and CD44 protein was validated with an AUC of 0.64. The patient stratification based on hypoxia-associated gene signatures status was similar to the original study but without significant differences in LRC and OS. CONCLUSIONS: In this validation study, the inclusion of the putative CSC marker CD44 slightly improved the prognostic performance of the baseline parameters tumour volume, p16 status and N stage. No improvement was observed when including expressions of the hypoxia-associated gene signatures. Prospective validation on a larger cohort is warranted to assess the clinical relevance of these markers.

AB  - Several biomarkers are in use to improve the sensitivity and specificity of cervical cancer screening. Previously, increased expression of tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN1) was detected in premalignant and malignant cervical lesions and applied for cytology screening. To improve the specificity, a double immunoreaction with CLDN1/Ki67 was developed in the recent study. Parallel p16/Ki67 (CINtec(R) PLUS) and CLDN1/Ki67 dual-stained cytology and histology were performed and compared. p16/Ki67 immunoreaction showed positivity in 317 out of 1596 smears with negativity in 1072 and unacceptable reactions in 207 samples. CLDN1/Ki67 dual staining was positive in 200 of 1358 samples, negative in 962, whereas 196 smears could not be evaluated due to technical reasons. Considering the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology as gold standard, sensitivity of CLDN1/Ki67 reaction was 76%, specificity was 85.67%, while for p16/Ki67 sensitivity was 74% and specificity was 81.38%. Comparison of CLDN1/Ki67 and p16/Ki67 dual stainings showed the results of the two tests not to be significantly different. Analysing histological slides from 63 cases, the results of the two tests agreed perfectly. As conclusion the sensitivity and specificity proved to be similar using p16/Ki67 and CLDN1/Ki67 double immunoreactions both on LBC samples and on histological slides.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Standardized uptake value (SUV) and related parameters derived from 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) PET/CT prior to radiochemotherapy of head and neck cancer (HNC) were significantly associated with survival in a number of studies. The aim of this study was to validate these findings and to evaluate the prognostic role of PET parameters also including clinical factors and HPV status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 166 HNC cases with a radiotherapy planning FDG PET/CT scan. All patients received radiotherapy, 68-70 Gy with or without concomitant cisplatin. Primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Twelve clinical factors, including HPV, performance status, stage and treatment parameters and ten PET/CT image parameters including gross tumor volume (GTV), metastatic lymph node volume, SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), were collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: Of the 166 patients included, 48 had locoregional and 23 had metastatic recurrence. None of the FDG PET parameters were significant in the univariate analysis using DFS as endpoint. HPV status, ECOG status and GTV-U (primary tumor and lymph node volume from CT) were statistically significant (p < 0.01). Only in the subgroup of HPV-unrelated HNC (HPV negative oropharyngeal cancer [OPC] and non-OPC; n = 73), the multivariate model could be improved by including MTV (p < 0.001). DFS events were 29 (31%) in HPV-related and 53 (73%) in HPV-unrelated HNC. CONCLUSION: FDG PET parameters appear less important for overall prognostication of radiochemotherapy outcome for HNC. Still, the association between the FDG PET parameters and survival is strong for HNC not related to HPV. Tumor volume from CT is generally more closely related to outcome than parameters derived from FDG PET/CT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour mutational burden (TMB) estimated from whole exome sequencing or comprehensive gene panels has previously been established as predictive factor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Its predictive value for the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiation (cCRTX), a potential combination partner of ICI, remains unknown. METHODS: The accuracy of TMB estimation by an in-house 327-gene panel was established in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) data set. Interference of TMB with outcome after cCRTX was determined in a multicentre cohort of patients with locally advanced HNSCC uniformly treated with cCRTX. Targeted next-generation sequencing was successfully applied in 101 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pretreatment tumour samples. In a subset of cases (n = 40), tumour RNA was used for immune-related gene expression profiling by the nanoString platform. TMB was correlated with TP53 genotype, human papilloma virus (HPV) status, immune expression signatures and survival parameters. Results were validated in the TCGA HNSCC cohort. RESULTS: A high accuracy of TMB estimation by the 327-gene panel was established. High TMB was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of TP53 mutations and immune gene expression patterns unrelated to T cell-inflamed gene expression profiles. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly reduced overall survival in the patient group with high TMB (hazard ratio for death: 1.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-3.14; P = 0.042) which remained significant after correcting for confounding factors in the multivariate model. The prognostic value of TMB was confirmed in the TCGA HNSCC cohort. CONCLUSION: High TMB identifies HNSCC patients with poor outcome after cCRTX who might preferentially benefit from CRTX-ICI combinations.

AB  - Roche cobas 4800 human papillomavirus (HPV) test is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction-based system that allows the simultaneous detection of 14 human papillomavirus high-risk (HR-HPV) genotypes. This test is Food and Drug Administration approved since 2011 for HPV determination in liquid-based cytologic samples, but a clinically validated technique for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens is presently not commercially available. In our laboratory, we have developed an HPV detection procedure in FFPE tissue by cobas 4800 HPV test. In order to validate our method, we retrospectively studied 165 FFPE cervical biopsy and conization specimens with varied diagnoses from our files. In 50 of them, we contrasted the results with those obtained from simultaneous liquid-based cytologies from the same patients. Finally, seeking the possible complementary clinical usefulness of the procedure, we compared the HPV genotypes detected in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1)-diagnosed biopsies from 20 patients with a subsequent high-grade CIN (CIN2+) diagnosis with those from another group of 20 patients without a subsequent CIN2+ diagnosis. Eighty-seven percent of the assays provided informative results. HR-HPV was detected in 28 of 32 (88%) invasive cervical squamous carcinomas. Coincidental HR-HPV genotypes were obtained in 32 of 50 (64%) cases with simultaneous cervical biopsy and liquid-based cytologic samples. A significant higher risk of progression to CIN2+ was found when HPV16 (P=0.022) or any HR-HPV genotype (P=0.037) was detected in CIN1 biopsies. The reported procedure provides an automated, technically time-saving, easy to integrate into laboratory routine, and reliable method of HR-HPV determination in FFPE specimens.

AB  - Since 2012, testing high-risk (HR)HPV has been used as the primary screening test for women >/=35 years attending the organized cervical cancer screening program in the city of Tampere. We evaluated the contribution of HPV16/18 genotyping. Data from 2012 and 2013, and the follow-up samples in 2013 and 2014, respectively, were analyzed. Abbott RealTime High-Risk HPV test detecting 14 HRHPV genotypes combined with concurrent genotyping for HPV16 and HPV18 was used. HPV was positive in 794 samples out of 11 346 HPV tested women (7%). HPV16/18 was represented in 22% of HPV-positive cases. Negative cervical cytology (NILM) was reported in 51% of HPV-positive samples. HPV16/18 genotype was accompanied with 50% of HSIL/ASC-H cases. The predominance of HPV16/18 in higher grade lesions was even more evident in cervical biopsies as 57% of CIN3 cases were associated with HPV16/18, and only 20% of carcinomas were associated with nonspecified high-risk (NSHR) genotypes. In agreement with previous studies HPV16/18 genotypes caused higher grade cytological and histological changes/pathologies than NSHR genotypes in primary screening. Nevertheless, the majority of HRHPV genotypes detected in the screened population were nonHPV16/18, and especially within persistent infections, precancerous lesions were found also among women with NSHR genotypes.

AB  - The evidence concerning prognostic parameters for clinical decision-making in penile cancer is either weak or missing. We therefore analysed the prognostic value of the revised TNM and WHO classification systems on relapse and survival with special emphasis on HPV status. We collected clinical data and tissue samples of 121 patients from centres in Germany and Russia. HPV genotyping and p16(INK4a) immunostaining were performed. The histological subtype and TNM were reclassified by two experienced uropathologists. Survival analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed by Cox proportional hazard model and Fisher's exact test for contingency analysis. HPV status was not found to be an independent prognostic factor. Histological subtypes differ in prognosis with the best outcome found in warty and the worst in basaloid carcinomas. Patients with pT1b defined by poor differentiation or lymphovascular invasion (LVI) had the shortest metastasis-free survival compared with pT1a (log-rank, p = 0.02). Lymph node metastasis and LVI were significantly associated with poor metastasis-free, cancer-specific and overall survival and could be identified as the only independent prognostic parameters. Prognostic value of TNM could not be improved using the 8th versus the 7th edition. In contrast to HPV status, histological subtypes are of prognostic value and should be an essential part of pathologic reports. The impact of the HPV status needs to be analysed in a subtype-specific manner. Parameters describing lymphatic dissemination have the highest impact on prognosis. Inclusion of tumour grade and LVI into a single T-category (pT1b) seems questionable.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Long-term infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of cervical cancer and its precursor - cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The presence of HPV infection can be presumed in more than 99% of cases of cervical cancer worldwide. The introduction of DNA testing for the presence of HPV has increased the effectiveness of screening programs for the detection of this cancer. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of high risk HPV DNA (HR HPV) in females from Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on 280 cervical smear samples. In this work we used the Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test to detect the HR HPV in cervical smear samples. RESULTS: 56 patients (20%) proved to be positive regarding HPV-16 DNA and 40 patients (14.28%) regarding HPV-18 DNA. In overall assessment, in 94 patients (33.57%) we detected oncogenic HPV subtypes, other than the two mentioned above. In 90 patients (32.14%) no high risk HPV was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test is a viable, effective, easy and quick tool in detecting high risk HPV DNA.

AB  - We hypothesized that in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high affinity receptor TrkB regulate tumor cell survival, invasion, and therapy resistance. We used in situ hybridization for BDNF and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TrkB in 131 HNSCC samples. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was highly expressed in normal mucosa in HNSCC tissue and in cell lines, whereas only 42.74% of HNSCC tissue was TrkB(+). One fourth of HNSCC cases was human papilloma virus (HPV)(-) positive, but the TrkB IHC frequency was not different in HPV-positive (HPV(+)) and negative cases. The UPCI-SCC090 cells expressed constitutive levels of TrkB. Transforming-growth-factor-beta1 (1 ng/mL TGF-beta1) induced TrkB in a subpopulation of SCC-25 cells. A single 10-microg/mL mitomycin C treatment in UPCI-SCC090 cells induced apoptosis and BDNF did not rescue them. The SCC-25 cells were resistant to the MMC treatment, and their growth decreased after TGF-beta1 treatment, but was restored by BDNF if it followed TGF-beta1. Taken together, BDNF might be ineffective in HPV(+) HNSCC patients. In HPV(-) HNSCC patients, tumor cells did not die after chemotherapeutic challenge and BDNF with TGF-beta1 could improve tumor cell survival and contribute to worse patient prognosis.

AB  - Longitudinal data on the E6/E7 mRNA-based Aptima human papillomavirus (AHPV) assay exceeding three years in comparison to the gold standard Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test are not available. We previously reported the cross-sectional data of the German AHPV Screening Trial (GAST) in which 10,040 women were recruited and tested by liquid-based cytology, the HC2 assay, and the AHPV assay. Four hundred eleven test-positive women were followed for up to six years. In addition, 3,295 triple-negative women were screened after a median time of six years. Overall, 28 high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) cases were detected. The absolute risk of developing high-risk HPV-positive CIN3+ over six years among those women that tested negative at baseline was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0 to 4.9) and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.7 to 5.7) per 1,000 women screened by the HC2 and the AHPV tests; the additional risk for those with AHPV-negative compared with HC2-negative results was 0.9 (95% CI, -0.2 to 2.1) per 1,000. In comparison, the absolute risk following a negative LBC test was 9.3 (95% CI, 2.9 to 30.2). The relative sensitivity of AHPV compared to HC2 was 91.5% for CIN3+, and the negative predictive values were 99.8% (95% CI, 99.5 to 99.9%) for HC2 and 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4 to 99.8%) for AHPV. Our data show that the longitudinal performance of the AHPV test over six years is comparable to the performance of the HC2 test and that the absolute risk of CIN3+ over six years following a negative AHPV result in a screening population is low. (This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT02634190.).

AB  - High-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) are causally related to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and subsequent cervical cancer (CC). The vaginal microbiome has been suggested to play a role in the development of CC, but the effect of conservative surgical treatment on the microbiome and hrHPV elimination has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to characterize the vaginal microbiome and inflammatory chemokine profile in 85 women treated for CIN2-CIN3 lesions, before and after surgical CIN removal. The results showed, as expected, a high prevalence of dysbiotic microbiomes and vaginal pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CIN cohort, correlated with disease severity, at the basal level. By contrast, surgical CIN removal induced significant vaginal microbiome variations, and specific microbiome/cytokine profiles were associated with hrHPV clearance/persistence at 6-month follow-up. hrHPV-cleared patients, in fact, showed a specific increase of L. crispatus and decrease of dysbiosis and inflammatory cytokines compared to hrHPV-persistent patients. These data highlight the crosstalk between HPV and the local microbiome, and suggest that vaginal microbiome modulation might represent a novel approach to modifying the natural history of hrHPV-related CC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the 2006 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines, positive CIN2 p16 in women over the age of 25 should be managed with excisional treatment. However, excisional treatment is associated with physical, psychological and obstetric morbidity and can have a negative impact on sexual function. In our study we sought to identify a clear management strategy, addressing the impact of routine use of p16 immunohistochemistry in this population and identify appropriate criteria for patient selection with the aim of reducing over-treatment. METHOD: We studied the medical records of 130 patients who had undergone laser therapy for CIN2. Each patient underwent colposcopy, biopsy and HPV test and were tested for p16 protein,. Patients were divided based on HPV infection into: single infections, multiple infections. All patients underwent ZTA laser therapy with follow-up (2-year follow-up). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Contingency tables were created to evaluate the correlation between single, multiple and CIN2+ infections. Values with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Single infections had a histological regression of 61.8% (21/34) and a histological persistence rate of 35.3% (12/34), which was greater than the multiple infection rate. The common characteristic that the women with persistence and progression had was the dimension of the lesion and the genotype 16. Ten cases of histological persistence and the only case of progression had one lesion greater than three quarters of the cervix. CONCLUSIONS: With the progress of our understanding of the natural history of infection from human papillomavirus and the increasing use of colposcopy, thanks to the addition of HPV genotyping and the technique of immunohistochemistry, conservative management of these lesions is now possible.

AB  - Background: High risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) are characterized by significantly better therapy responses. In order to implement a de-escalated treatment strategy for this tumor entity, it is highly crucial to accurately distinguish HPV-associated OPCs from non-HPV-associated ones. Methods: In this prospective study, 56 patients with histologically confirmed OPC were evaluated. A commercially available sandwich ELISA test system was used for the detection of hr-HPV E7 oncoprotein targeting the genotypes 16, 18 and 45. Results were presented as optical density. Positivity for HPV DNA and p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was taken as the reference method. Results: E7 positivity was significantly associated with the reference method (p = 0.048). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the E7 oncoptotein was 60.9% (95% CI 38.5 to 80.3%), 66.7% (95% CI 46% to 83.5%), 64.2% (95% CI 49.4 to 77.4%) and 63.01% (95% CI 48.9-75.2%), respectively, for the cutoff provided by the manufacturer. Conclusions: We found a significant association between E7 oncoprotein detection and the currently used combination. We believe that the use of the ELISA based E7 antigen test could be a valuable addition in cases of ambiguous findings and may be used in combination with other techniques to distinguish between HPV-driven and non-HPV-driven OPCs. However, the low sensitivity of the assay coupled with the small sample size in our study may represent a limitation. We recommend that future larger studies elucidate the diagnostic value of the E7 brush test.

AB  - HPV-infection in patients with HNSCC is reportedly correlated with sexual behavior, age, and tobacco/alcohol-consumption. HPV-infections of the oral cavity are regarded as sexually transmitted. Comparable data of patient populations outside the U.S. are sparse or missing. Questionnaires regarding sexual behavior, education tobacco- and alcohol-consumption, were given to 28 patients with tonsillar hyperplasia (H) and 128 patients with tonsillar carcinomas (CA), all with tissue-typed HPV-DNA-status performing PCR. Answers were correlated among groups and HPV-status. 106 questionnaires were analyzed. Comparisons between H- (n = 25) and CA- (n = 81) patients showed that CA-patients were older (61.1yrs +/- 9.3) than H-patients (45.2yrs +/- 11.9; p < 0.0001; Student's t-test); had a lower educational level (p = 0.0095); and lower number of sexual partners (p = 0.0222; Fisher's exact test). All groups showed a significant correlation between smoking and lack of HPV-DNA-positivity (p = 0.001). Further Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression analysis revealed in all 106 patients no significant correlations between tissue-HPV-status and the analyzed parameters. Despite the limited sample size, we were able to confirm the established correlation between smoking and tissue-HPV-status. The correlation between sexual behavior and HPV-infection was not confirmed. No consensus exists in the literature about the latter. Our data does not support the strict classification of oral HPV-infections and HPV-driven HNSCCs as STDs.

AB  - Carcinogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related (+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) differs from HPV-negative (-) OPSCC. HPV-related immune-escape-mechanism could be responsible for the development and progression of HPV+ tumors and an immunophenotype different from HPV- OPSCC is expected. The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its prognostic relevance in relation to CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I expression in OPSCC. We quantified PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TC) and macrophages and MHC I expression in association to CD8(+) TILs by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray derived from 171 HPV+/-OPSCC. HPV-status was determined by p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry/HPV-DNA detection. Presence of CD8(+) TILs, PD-L1 expression on TC, and a more frequent loss of MHC I in HPV+ compared to HPV- OPSCC was detected. A high amount of CD8(+) TILs in the whole cohort and in HPV+ OPSCC and PD-L1 expression on TC in HPV- OPSCC was associated with favorable overall survival. There was a trend for an improved outcome according to PD-L1 expression (macrophages) in HPV+ OPSCC without reaching statistical significance. CD8(+) TILs and PD-L1-expression have prognostic impact in OPSCC and might present useful biomarkers for predicting clinical outcome and personalized therapy concepts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: All cervical cancers and some vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers are caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). However, little is known about the association between cervical HPV infection and subsequent intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer at other anogenital sites. In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the risk of vulvar, vaginal and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or cancer (VIN2+, VaIN2+, AIN2+) according to cervical hrHPV status. METHODS: Liquid-based cervical cytology samples were collected from 40,399 women screened against cervical cancer in Copenhagen, Denmark, during 2002-2005. Samples were tested for hrHPV using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and genotyped using INNO-LiPA. We linked the cohort with Danish nationwide registries to identify cases of VIN2+, VaIN2+ and AIN2+ during up to 15 years of follow-up. We estimated age-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression and cumulative incidences using Aalen-Johansen's estimator. RESULTS: Women with cervical HPV16 infection had increased hazard of VIN2+ (HR = 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.5), VaIN2+ (HR = 23.5; 95% CI, 6.8-81.6) and AIN2+ (HR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2) compared with HC2 negative women. Women with other hrHPV types than HPV16 also had increased hazard of VaIN2+ (HR = 7.1; 95% CI, 2.3-22.3) and a borderline statistically significantly increased risk of AIN2+ (HR = 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9-4.9) compared with HC2 negative women. The 10-year cumulative incidences of VIN2+, VaIN2+ and AIN2+ in women with cervical HPV16 were 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.7%), 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-0.5%) and 0.1% (95 CI, 0.0%-0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Cervical HPV16 infection is associated with increased risk of VIN2+, VaIN2+ and AIN2+.

AB  - There is evidence to suggest that human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with Barrett's dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma. In other HPV-linked cancers such as cervical and oropharyngeal cancer, circulating HPV DNA is a potential biomarker to assist in tumor diagnosis and management. This study aimed to determine whether circulating HPV DNA was detectable in patients with Barrett's dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma, and if so, whether there is any correlation with esophageal tissue HPV status. Plasma from 138 patients representing esophageal adenocarcinoma (N = 41), Barrett's dysplasia (N = 48) and hospital controls (N = 49) were analyzed for the presence of circulating HPV DNA using droplet-digital PCR targeting the E7 gene of HPV types 16 and 18. Circulating HPV DNA was detected in 11/138 (8.0%) study subjects including 1/49 (2.0%) hospital controls, 4/48 (8.3%) Barrett's dysplasia patients, and 6/41 (14.6%) esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. Detection of circulating HPV DNA was higher in patients with HPV-positive esophageal tissue (6/35, 17.1%) compared to those with HPV-negative specimens (5/103; 4.9%) (OR = 4.06; 95% CI 1.15-14.25; P = 0.020). The highest rates of detection occurred in esophageal adenocarcinoma patients, particularly those with invasive tumors that had breached the esophageal submucosa, had regional lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. Circulating HPV DNA was detectable in a subset of Barrett's dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. Detection was associated with tissue HPV positivity and possibly disease severity.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a distinct subtype of head and neck cancer. Here, we investigated how frequently brushing remained high-risk (hr)-HPV positive after treatment and whether patients with positive post-treatment brushings have a higher recurrence rate. Following the end of treatment of patients with initially hr-HPV positive OPSCC, surface brushings from the previous tumor site were performed and tested for hr-HPV DNA. Of 62 patients with initially hr-HPV DNA-positive OPSCC, seven patients remained hr-HPV-DNA positive at post-treatment follow-up. Of the seven hr-HPV-positive patients at follow-up, five had a tumor relapse or tumor progression, of whom three died. The majority of patients (55/62) was HPV-negative following treatment. All HPV-negative patients remained free of disease (p = 0.0007). In this study, all patients with recurrence were hr-HPV-positive with the same genotype as that before treatment. In patients who were hr-HPV negative after treatment, no recurrence was observed.

AB  - The Alinity m HR HPV assay (Alinity) is a novel human papillomavirus (HPV) assay that individually identifies genotypes HPV16, HPV18, and HPV45 while reporting on 11 other high-risk HPV (hrHPV) genotypes in two aggregates: HPV31/33/52/58 and HPV35/39/51/56/59/66/68. The clinical performance of Alinity for screening for cervical cancer was evaluated in population-based settings. For women aged >/=30 years, the clinical sensitivity (n = 68) and specificity (n = 3,077) for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) of Alinity were 100.0% and 92.4%, respectively, and were not inferior to those of the Qiagen Digene Hybrid Capture 2 high-risk HPV DNA assay (hc2) (P = 0.0006 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The intralaboratory reproducibility and interlaboratory agreement of Alinity were 96.7% (kappa, 0.92) and 98.7% (kappa, 0.97), respectively. In the group >/=30 years of age, women who were baseline hrHPV negative had a lower risk for CIN2+ at 3 years using Alinity (0.04%) than those with a normal baseline cytology (0.65%) and had a risk comparable to that determined by the Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV assay (0.04%), hc2 (0.08%), or the Roche Cobas 4800 HPV assay (0.04%). High-risk HPV16/18 infection was associated with a significantly higher baseline and 3-year CIN2+ and CIN3+ risk than the absence of HPV16/18 or the presence of hrHPVs at the baseline (all P values were <0.05). The baseline CIN2+ risk was 8.8% for those with HPV31/33/52/58 infection and 2.5% for those with HPV35/39/51/56/59/66/68 infection, while the 3-year CIN2+ risk was 17.0% and 4.9%, respectively (relative risk, 3.4 [P = 0.03] and 3.5 [P = 0.003], respectively), suggesting that extended genotyping by Alinity may be valuable in improving patient risk stratification. Alinity fulfills international consensus guideline criteria for primary cervical cancer screening and can be considered clinically validated, demonstrating safety comparable to that of other clinically validated HPV tests.

AB  - PURPOSE: Human papilloma virus (HPV) as the most common viral infection of the anogenital tract is highly associated with intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer of the cervix and other anogential regions. To date, 15 high-risk (HR-) HPV and 3 probably/possibly HR-HPVs have been found to be associated with cervical cancer. Therefore, a screening especially for HR-HPV by appropriate tests is important for detection of precancerous lesions to prevent cancer. The purpose of this study was to analyze prospectively the concordance of the EUROArray HPV genotyping assay (Euroimmun; EUROArray) and the HPV 3.5 LCD-Array Kit (Chipron; LCD-Array). METHODS: Liquid-based, clinician-collected cervical cytology samples (n = 163) from women undergoing cervical inspection at the dysplasia consultation in the colposcopy clinic at the Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Germany were analyzed. Genotype-specific agreement was assessed by Cohen's kappa statistic and McNemar's P value of significance between proportions. RESULTS: Seventeen of the HR-HPV genotypes included in both assays were detected in 42.3% and 38% of samples by EUROArray and by LCD-Array, respectively; i.e. an agreement of 92.0% and a kappa value of 0.83 could be proven between the EUROArray and the LCD-Array. In 50 of 72 samples, identical HR-HPV genotypes were analyzed (81.9%, kappa = 0.47) and genotyping for HPV 16 and/or 18 was highly concordant in both tests (relative agreement 96.3%, kappa = 0.88). Detection of any HR-HPV was not significantly different after comparison of EUROArray with LCD-Array. CONCLUSION: Both of the tests showed comparable results for the detection of HPV in cervical specimens and permit these assays to be suitable for routine diagnostics.

AB  - (1) Background: The novel hybrid of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) examination has been introduced to clinical practice. The aim of our study was to evaluate PET/MR usefulness in preoperative staging of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients (pts); (2) Methods: Thirty eight pts underwent both computed tomography (CT) and PET/MR examination, of whom 21 pts underwent surgical treatment as first-line therapy and were further included in the present study. Postsurgical tissue material was subjected to routine histopathological (HP) examination with additional evaluation of p16, human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Ki67 status. Agreement of clinical and pathological T staging, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of CT and PET/MR in metastatic lymph nodes detection were defined. The verification of dependences between standardized uptake value (SUV value), tumor geometrical parameters, number of metastatic lymph nodes in PET/MR and CT, biochemical parameters, Ki67 index, p16, HPV and EBV status was made with statistical analysis of obtained results; (3) Results: PET/MR is characterized by better agreement in T staging, higher specificity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV of lymph nodes evaluation than CT imaging. Significant correlations were observed between SUVmax and maximal tumor diameter from PET/MR, between SUVmean and CT tumor volume, PET/MR tumor volume, maximal tumor diameter assessed in PET/MR. Other correlations were weak and insignificant; (4) Conclusions: Hybrid PET/MR imaging is useful in preoperative staging of HNC. Further studies are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic viral infections caused by highly contagious human papillomaviruses (HPVs) from the alpha genus are a substantial risk factor for tumour diseases. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare the HPV infection pattern with histology in a patient group of immunocompromised HIV(+) and non-immunocompromised patients with anal intraepithelial neoplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples (n = 210) from the anogenital area of 121 patients underwent retrospective histological and molecular examination for HPV DNA prevalence by chip analysis. The study was part of a cancer screening from the Dermatology Department of the LMU Munich, Germany. All data were collected and processed anonymously. RESULTS: HPV 6 or 11 are more abundant in tissue samples from histologically diagnosed condylomata acuminata (47.7%) compared to grade 1, 2, and 3 intraepithelial neoplasias (IN 1-3). Detection of high-risk (hr) alpha-HPV DNA was significantly higher in tissue samples from IN 3 (67.5%) compared to IN 1 and 2 (12.9%), and compared to condylomata acuminata (29.5%). No HPV types were detected in histologically unremarkable tissue samples. There was a significant association between the prevalence of HPV 16 and the classifications IN 1 to IN 3 (chi(2) (2) = 13.62, P = 0.001). We identified a significant correlation between the prevalence of high-risk and low-risk (lr) HPV types and HIV, especially mixed infections of different HPV types correlated with high-grade IN. Based on the present data, we suggest the risk of carcinoma in HIV(+/-) patients (RICH) score and test it in the 121 patients. CONCLUSIONS: hr alpha-HPVs, mainly HPV 16, are associated with increased oncogenic potential of premalignant lesions (IN 1-3), especially in HIV(+) patients. Based on the combination of HIV/HPV-testing and histological analysis, we identified correlations that could potentially forecast the risk of malignant transformation and summarized them in the form of RICH score.

AB  - PURPOSE: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) link to a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Our aim was to identify clinicopathological characteristics (CPC) of squamous cell carcinomas of the posterior oral cavity and oropharynx (SCCPOCO) associated with HPV p16(+). METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study design, we enrolled a sample of SCCPOCO patients treated in a Central German hospital over a 3-year period. The predictor variables: CPCs, were grouped into demographic, social, anatomic and prognostic. The main outcome variable was p16(+). Appropriate statistics were computed, and P</=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 199 HNSCC patients, 23 had SCCPOCO and entered the analysis (mean age, 67+/-12 years; 4 females; 16 in stage I; 4 p16(+); 22 underwent primary surgery). We found 8 cervical lymph node metastases (34.8%), 3 distant metastases (13%), 9 recurrences (30.1%) and 3 overall deaths (13%). With the exception of recurrence (P=0.006) and overall death (P=0.02), p16(+) was not associated with predictor variables: young age, male gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, tumor location, TNM stages, time to recurrence, metastases, death from disease and survival of smokers (P>0.05). Primary brachytherapy failed to improve survival of p16(+)-SCCPOCO patients (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that p16(+)- and p16(-)-SCCPOCOs in Central Germany share similar CPCs, except recurrence and overall death. Upfront surgery with/without radio(chemo)therapy is recommended for all operable SCCPOCOs, regardless of HPV-status. Patients with p16(+)-SCCPOCOs require close follow-up. Future research should investigate the cause of these distinctive CPCs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate long-term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) risks associated with different triage strategies for human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) women with a view to reducing unnecessary referrals. DESIGN: The ARTISTIC trial cohort was recruited in Manchester in 2001-03 and was followed up for CIN3 and cancer notification through national registration until December 2015. RESULTS: The 10-year cumulative risk of CIN3+ was much higher for women with HPV16/18 infection (19.4%, 95% CI 15.8-23.8% with borderline/low-grade cytology and 10.7%, 95% CI 8.3-13.9% with normal cytology) than for those with other HPV types (7.3%, 95% CI 5.4-9.7% with borderline/low-grade cytology and 3.2%, 95% CI 2.2-4.5% with normal cytology). Among the 379 women with normal to low-grade cytology and new HPV infection, the 10-year cumulative CIN3+ risk was 2.9% (95% CI 1.6-5.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The CIN3 risk is confined to women with persistent type-specific HPV so partial genotyping test assays identifying HPV16/18 as a minimum are essential for efficient risk stratification. Immediate referral to colposcopy for HPV+ women with borderline or low-grade cytology and referral after a year if still HPV+ with normal cytology may be unnecessary. Low-grade lesions can safely be retested to identify those with persistent HPV. Recall intervals of 1 year for HPV16/18 and 2 years for other high-risk HPVs are justified for women with normal cytology and might also be considered for women with borderline/low-grade cytology. The minimal risk of invasive cancer that has progressed beyond stage 1A must be weighed against the advantages for patients and the NHS of reducing the number of referrals to colposcopy. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Cervical screening would be better for women and cheaper for the NHS if women with HPV and normal to low-grade cytology were retested after a year or two when many infections will have cleared.

AB  - Introduction In Germany, the HPV-attributable fraction in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) has been rising constantly over the last decades. Although epidemiological and molecular evidence supports a causal role of HPV, mainly type 16, in OPC, we still have limited understanding of how oncogenic oral HPV infections progress into cancer. Thus, early detection of HPVdriven OPC remains challenging. Antibodies to HPV16 early proteins, especially E6, are strongly associated with incident but also prospective HPV-OPC. Within a prospective epidemiological cohort we analyzed HPV16 serum antibodies to identify patients at high risk for HPV-driven OPC. Patients and Methods The study is embedded within the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS), a single center, prospective, epidemiologic cohort study to improve risk stratification, early diagnosis and survival. 45.000 participants of the city of Hamburg age 45-74 years will be recruited between 2017 and 2023. Of the first enrollment batch of 5000 HCHS participants 4203 sera were locally tested with a HPV16 E6 screening ELISA to identify participants with high antibody titer (> 0.25 OD); screen-positive sera were validated by ELISA additionally targeting HPV16 E1, E2, and E7. Results Forty-eight (1.1%) sera were HPV16 E6 screening ELISA positive. Four had antibodies to at least one additional E protein; these were considered as high risk individuals for prevalent or developing OPC. Upon re-contact, and head and neck medical examination, one patient was identified with an asymptomatic OPC (cT2 cN1 cM0). Conclusions Screening and validation HPV16 ELISA is locally feasible and appears to have favorable characteristics to identify patients at high risk for HPV-OPC at an early stage.

AB  - Background: The detection rate of histologically confirmed high grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) and anal carcinoma by screening with anal cytological (cyto.) smears and/or human papilloma virus (HPV) typing in HIVpositive individuals (HIV+) has been examined in the TECAIN Study. Method(s): The prospective, randomized, national, multicenter TECAIN study compared the efficacy of local treatment with 85% trichloroacetic acid to electrocaustic ablation of histologically confirmed AIN in HIV+ since 2015 in Germany. Biopsies of AIN lesions, anal cyto. Swabs and HPV typing were performed at Baseline and follow-up visits. The cyto. findings were divided according to the Bethesda classification. Depending on their oncogenic potential HIV types were distinguished into high risk (HR) and low risk (LR) HPV. The consistencies between HPV types, the cyto. results and histologic findings were analysed. Result(s): 292 examinations (exa.) in 184 HIV+ included during the TECAIN Study were analyzed until September 12, 2019. At Baseline the median age was 48 years, 98% of HIV+ took antiretroviral therapy and 81% were MSM. Histologically, 108 exa. (37%) showed AIN I as the highest grade HPV-associated lesion, 84 (29%) AIN II and 100 (34%) AIN III. Thus in 184 exa. (63%) HGAIN were detected. At the same time, LSIL diagnosed in 84 (29%), ASC-US in 76 (26%), HSIL in 99 (34%) and negative cyto. results in 33 (11%) cases. Virologically, in 251 cases (86%) at least one HR-HPV could be diagnosed and 28 (10%) LR-HPV. No HPV was detected in 13 (4%) exa. A cyto. screening found no HSIL in 66.3% of all HGAIN cases. No HR-HPV was detected in 12% of all HGAIN cases. If both cytology and virology results were considered together, only 10.3% of all HGAIN cases showed no higher grade abnormalities. Conclusion(s): Simultaneous screening with anal cyto. and virological smears detect HGAIN much more reliable than cytology alone (fig. 1). Comparable results in gynecology have led to an extension of routine diagnostics by the addition of HPV typing to cervical cancer screening guidelines in Germany. Fig. 1: Results (n=292) of virological and cytological examinations of all HGAIN cases in the TECAIN RCT and detection rates in simultaneous screening of cytological (C+) and virological (V+) smears.

AB  - Background: Avelumab (anti-PD-L1) has shown antitumor activity in patients with various solid tumors. We report results from a cohort of patients with R/M SCCHN treated with avelumab monotherapy in the JAVELIN Solid Tumor phase I trial (NCT01772004). Method(s): Eligible patients had platinum-refractory/ineligible R/M SCCHN and received avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Assessments included objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator and independent review committee (IRC), overall survival (OS), and safety. PD-L1+ status (expression in >=1% of tumor cells [73-10 assay]) and HPV status (p16 immunohistochemistry) were assessed centrally. Result(s): 153 patients were enrolled and received avelumab; 117 (76.5%) and 29 (19.0%) had >=2 and >=4 prior lines of therapy, respectively (median, 2 [range, 1-7]). At data cut-off (31 Dec 2017), median follow-up was 27.9 mo (range, 25-32 mo), and 10 patients (6.5%) remained on treatment. Based on IRC and investigator assessment, respectively, the ORR was 9.2% (95% CI: 5.1%-14.9%) and 13.1% (95% CI: 8.2%-19.5%); median PFS (95% CI) was 1.4 mo (1.4-2.6 mo) and 1.8 mo (1.4-2.7 mo). Median OS was 8.0 mo (95% CI: 6.5-10.2 mo), and 1- and 2-year OS rates were 35.9% (95% CI: 28.3%-43.6%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 11.5%-23.7%), respectively. In patients with PD-L1+ (n=107) or PD-L1- (n=30) tumors, ORR (95% CI) by IRC was 10.3% (5.2%-17.7%) vs 3.3% (0.1%-17.2%) and by investigator was 15.0% (8.8%-23.1%) vs 6.7% (0.8%-22.1%), respectively. In HPV+ (n=39) and HPV- (n=99) subgroups, ORR (95% CI) by IRC was 15.4% (5.9%-30.5%) vs 5.1% (1.7%-11.4%) and by investigator was 17.9% (7.5%-33.5%) vs 11.1% (5.7%-19.0%), respectively. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 83 patients (54.2%), including grade >=3 TRAEs in 10 (6.5%), and led to discontinuation in 4 (2.6%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 6 patients (3.9%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Conclusion(s): Avelumab showed clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated patients with platinum-refractory/ineligible R/M SCCHN.

AB  - Purpose: HPV-attributable cancer is a preventable disease. An estimated ~7.600 people in Germany were predicted to be diagnosed with an HPV-attributable cancer1,2. The proportion of oropharyngeal (OP) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was assumed to be relatively low (16-20%) based on a pooled analysis of European study results. As country specific results on the changing epidemiology of oropharyngeal (OP) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in Germany is available3, our aim was to update previous estimates on the incidence of HPV-attributable cancer for Germany. Method(s): Nationwide cancer incidence on HPV-related SCC for 2016 was calculated based on estimates of cancer incidence rates from the Center for Cancer Registry Data for Germany. Proportions of cancers attributable to HPV-infection (HPV-AF) were calculated according to previously published methods2, taking new country specific results on HPV-prevalence in OPSCC into account. Result(s): Two clinical studies from Germany attribute >50% of most recently diagnosed OPSCC to HPV (years of diagnosis 2013/2015). When taking the country specific prevalence in OPSCC into account, the HPVAF in OPSCC will be more than twice as high as previously reported. The total number of HPV-attributable cancer in Germany then approaches 10.000 new cases a year. Conclusion(s): Previous estimates attributed a significantly lower proportion of OPSCC to HPV than most recent study results from two single medical institutions in Germany suggest. Although the calculation of HPV-related cancer burden remains methodologically challenging, recent evidence indicates that oropharyngeal cancer increasingly contributes to the burden of cancer. The HPV-AF for OPSCC in Germany will best be estimated by direct testing of HPV DNA/p16 overexpression/E6-E7 mRNA expression in continuous representative sentinel sampling of tumor tissue for monitoring the effects of HPV-vaccination in the German population.

AB  - Recently, cervical cancer rates elevation has been noted in women aged 20-39 years in regions with a very high human development index (HDI). The onset of cancer elevation rates is observed in the age range of 25-29 years, which should necessitate effective precancer screening in younger age groups, including those <25 years. From 30.066 liquid-based screening tests results (n = 30.066), 3849 liquid-based cytology, 1321 high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) and 316 p16/Ki67 performed in women <30 years were selected. Performance characteristics were calculated for three screening models: primary HRHPV with p16/Ki67 triage, primary cytology with reflex HPV and primary cytology alone. Primary HRHPV with p16/Ki67 triage was significantly more sensitive in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion quantified with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse [HSIL(CIN2+)] detection than cytology with reflex HRHPV and cytology alone (83.3% vs. 70.8%/45.8%) and had significantly higher diagnostic predictive values (PPV:29.4%/21.3%/22.9%; NPV:91.7%/82.9%/82.2%, respectively at CIN2+ threshold). The number of colposcopies per HSIL(CIN2+) detection indices was 3.4, 4.7 and 4.4, respectively. Primary HPV testing in women <30 years with p16/Ki67 triage of HPV-positive cases might be an effective cervical cancer screening strategy for HSIL(CIN2+) detection with superior diagnostic performance when compared with primary cytology-based models. Women <25 years might also benefit from an introduction to a more sensitive screening approach.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) can be induced by smoking or alcohol consumption, but a growing part of cases relate to a persistent high-risk papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Viral etiology has a beneficial impact on the prognosis, which may be explained by a specific immune response. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the main immune population of the tumor microenvironment with a controversial influence on the prognosis. In this study, the level, phenotype, and spatial distribution of TAMs were evaluated, and the expression of TAM-associated markers was compared in HPV positive (HPV+) and HPV negative (HPV-) tumors. Seventy-three formalin and embedded in paraffin (FFPE) tumor specimens were examined using multispectral immunohistochemistry for the detection of TAM subpopulations in the tumor parenchyma and stroma. Moreover, the mRNA expression of TAM markers was evaluated using RT-qPCR. Results were compared with respect to tumor etiology, and the prognostic significance was evaluated. In HPV- tumors, we observed more pro-tumorigenic M2 in the stroma and a non-macrophage arginase 1 (ARG1)-expressing population in both compartments. Moreover, higher mRNA expression of M2 markers-cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), ARG1, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)-was detected in HPV- patients, and of M1 marker nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in HPV+ group. The expression of ARG1 mRNA was revealed as a negative prognostic factor for overall survival of HNSCC patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A possible oncogenic role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck cancers (mainly oropharynx tumors) has been suggested. This significant association has been considered true for oropharynx tumors; however, the association between HPV infection and laryngeal carcinomas is yet to be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between p16 expression and long-term overall, disease-free, and disease-specific survival (OS, DF, and DSS, respectively) in patients surgically treated for laryngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four previously untreated laryngeal carcinoma patients who underwent surgical treatment were considered for this retrospective study. The tissue specimens were processed for immunohistochemical p16 protein (surrogate HPV marker) detection. RESULTS: Survival analysis of the p16 expression of the primary tumor showed that the 5-year OS rates were 90% and 29.7% for the p16-positive and negative groups, respectively (P = .003). The 5-year DFS and DSS also differed between both groups (P < .001), whereas the 5-year DSS seemed to be related to tumor/lymph node classification and p16 expression. However, only p16 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor associated with OS and DSS. CONCLUSIONS: Surgically treated p16-positive laryngeal cancer patients may represent a subset of patients with a better prognosis than their p16-negative counterparts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study used dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to elucidate possible associations with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), stroma ratio and vimentin expression in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). METHODS: Overall, 26 patients with primary HNSCC of different localizations were involved in the study. DCE-MRI was obtained on a 3 T MRI and analyzed with a whole lesion measurement using a histogram approach. TIL- and vimentin-expression was calculated on bioptic samples before any form of treatment. P16 staining was used to define HPV-status. RESULTS: Tumor-stroma ratio correlated with entropy derived from K(trans) (r = - 0.52, p = 0.0071) and with kurtosis derived from V(e) (r = - 0.53, p = 0.0058). Several V(e) derived parameters correlated with expression of TIL within the stroma compartment. TIL within the tumor compartment correlated with entropy derived from K(trans) (r = 0.39, p = 0.047), p90 derived from V(e) (r = 0.41, p = 0.036) and skewness derived from V(e) (r = 0.41, p = 0.037). Furthermore, these associations were different between HPV positive and negative tumors. CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI might be able to reflect tumor compartments and TIL expression in HNSCC. The most promising parameters were values derived from K(trans) and V(e).

AB  - AIMS: The transcriptional activity of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) within oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) has been linked to improved survival of patients. HR-HPV mRNA silver in situ hybridization (SISH) was evaluated on a cohort of OPSCC and compared with viral HPV DNA tests and p16 expression. Clinical outcomes of HPV-driven OPSCC and non-HPV related OPSCC were also studied. METHODS: We evaluated 67 OPSCC and 3 papillomas, obtained from 62 patients, for detection of HR-HPV DNA by PCR tests. The positive samples were additionally studied by the SISH method using three probes of HPV16, HPV18, and HP33, and for p16 expression detected by immunohistochemistry. SISH assays were evaluated for the presence/number and intensity of signals in cancer cells. Prognostic significance of HPV status in our cohort was evaluated with univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: According to the HR-HPV PCR tests, 46 (69%) OPSCC cases were HPV positive, while three papillomas were negative. Of total 46 HPV-positive OPSCCs, 43 cases were also SISH-positive, while p16 overexpression was found in 45 of 46 HPV positive OPSCC cases. In OPSCC specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of the combined SISH probes (HPV16 and 33) were both 100.00%, when compared to HPV PCR. HPV positivity of the tumors appeared significant for predicting progression-free survival, cause specific survival and overall survival in a multivariate setting. CONCLUSIONS: The recently developed mRNA SISH methodology can detect HPV-driven OPSCCs without any additional test in 79% of cases. Positive SISH signals enable the visualization of viral transcripts required to recognize clinically relevant HPV infection. However, rare and tiny signals require an experienced pathologist to establish a consensus interpretation of results. The currently applied HR-HPV mRNA SISH analysis may serve as a groundwork for additional studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The genomic alterations contributing to the pathogenesis of conjunctival squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and their precursor lesions are poorly understood and hamper our ability to develop molecular therapies to reduce the recurrence rates and treatment-related morbidities of this disease. We aimed to characterize the somatic DNA alterations in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative conjunctival SCC. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with conjunctival SCC in situ or SCC treated in ocular oncology referral centers in Denmark were included. HPV detection (HPV DNA PCR, p16 immunohistochemistry, and mRNA in situ hybridization) and targeted capture-based next-generation sequencing of 523 genes frequently involved in cancer were performed to describe the mutational profile based on HPV status. RESULTS: Tumor tissue was available in 33 cases (n = 8 conjunctival SCCs in situ, n = 25 conjunctival SCCs), constituting 25 male and 8 female patients. Nine cases were HPV positive. The HPV-positive SCCs in situ and SCCs were characterized by transcriptionally active high-risk HPV (types 16 and 39) within the tumor cells, frequent mutations in PIK3CA (n = 5/9), and wild-type TP53, CDKN2A, and RB1, while the HPV-negative counterparts harbored frequent mutations in TP53 (n = 21/24), CDKN2A (n = 7/24), and RB1 (n = 6/24). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have delineated two potentially distinct distributions of somatic mutations in conjunctival SCC based on HPV status-pointing to different biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The present findings support a causal role of HPV in a subset of conjunctival SCC.

AB  - Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is clinically relevant in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We hypothesized that EMT-transcription factors (EMT-TFs) and an anti-EMT factor, Kruppel-like-factor-4 (KLF4) regulate EMT in HNSCC. Ten control mucosa and 37 HNSCC tissue samples and three HNSCC cell lines were included for investigation of EMT-TFs, KLF4 and vimentin at mRNA and protein levels. Slug gene expression was significantly higher, whereas, KLF4 gene expression was significantly lower in HNSCC than in normal mucosa. In the majority of HNSCC samples, there was a significant negative correlation between KLF4 and Slug gene expression. Slug gene expression was significantly higher in human papilloma virus (HPV) negative HNSCC, and in tumor samples with irregular p53 gene sequence. Transforming-growth-factor-beta-1 (TGF- beta1) contributed to downregulation of KLF4 and upregulation of Slug. Two possible regulatory pathways could be suggested: (1) EMT-factors induced pathway, where TGF-beta1 induced Slug together with vimentin, and KLF4 was down regulated at the same time; (2) p53 mutations contributed to upregulation and stabilization of Slug, where also KLF4 could co-exist with EMT-TFs.

AB  - Thyroid hormone levels may be associated with disease outcome in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). micro-Crystallin (CRYM), a thyroid hormone binding protein, blocks intracellular binding of the thyroid hormone T3 to its receptors. In this study, we aimed to analyze the association of CRYM levels with disease outcome in HNSCC patients. We retrospectively assessed immunohistochemical CRYM expression in 121 head and neck cancer patients. Preoperative thyrotropin levels could be extracted for 50 patients. Patients with low thyrotropin levels had a worse prognosis compared to euthyroid patients (5-year overall survival TSH low 20% vs. TSH norm 58%). We observed an association of CRYM+ patients with improved overall survival (5-year overall survival for CRYM+ 78.6% vs. CRYM- 56%). Interaction analysis between CRYM and HPV revealed that this effect was limited to HPV- patients (CRYM+|HPV- HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.87, p = 0.036). These results were replicated in an independent dataset. CRYM expression identified patients with favorable disease progression for HPV- HNSCC patients and could serve as a useful biomarker in this patient population. This study further confirms a correlation of thyroid hormone levels with adverse disease outcome in HNSCC patients, which could be potentially exploited as a therapeutic target.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are 2 known pathways for tumorigenesis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma-a human papillomavirus-dependent pathway characterized by p16 overexpression and a human papillomavirus-independent pathway linked to lichen sclerosus, characterized by TP53 mutation. A correlation of human papillomavirus dependency with a favorable prognosis has been proposed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to further understand the role of human papillomavirus and p53 status in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and characterize its clinical relevance. STUDY DESIGN: The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaecological Oncology Chemo and Radiotherapy in Epithelial Vulvar Cancer-1 study is a retrospective cohort study of 1618 patients with primary vulvar squamous cell carcinoma Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique stage >/=1B treated at 29 gynecologic cancer centers in Germany between 1998 and 2008. For this translational substudy, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was collected. A tissue microarray was constructed (n=652 samples); p16 and p53 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Human papillomavirus status and subtype were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: p16 immunohistochemistry was positive in 166 of 550 tumors (30.2%); p53 staining in 187 of 597 tumors (31.3%). Only tumors with available information regarding p16 and p53 immunohistochemistry and without p53 silent expression pattern were further analyzed (n=411); 3 groups were defined: p53+ (n=163), p16+/p53- (n=132), and p16-/p53- (n=116). Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 85.6% of p16+/p53- tumors; human papillomavirus-16 was the most common subtype (86.3%). Patients with p16+ tumors were younger (64 vs 72 years for p53+, respectively, 69 years for p16-/p53- tumors; P<.0001) and showed lower rates of lymph-node involvement (28.0% vs 42.3% for p53+, respectively, 30.2% for p16-/p53- tumors; P=.050). Notably, 2-year-disease-free and overall survival rates were significantly different among the groups: disease-free survival, 47.1% (p53+), 60.2% (p16-/p53-), and 63.9% (p16+/p53-) (P<.001); overall survival, 70.4% (p53+), 75.4% (p16-/p53-), and 82.5% (p16+/p53-) (P=.002). In multivariate analysis, the p16+/p53- phenotype showed a consistently improved prognosis compared with the other groups (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.99; P=.042). CONCLUSION: p16 overexpression is associated with an improved prognosis whereas p53 positivity is linked to an adverse outcome. Our data support the hypothesis of a clinically relevant third subgroup of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma with a p53-/p16- phenotype showing an intermediate prognosis that needs to be further characterized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main risk factors for head and neck cancer (HNC) are tobacco and alcohol use. However, an important fraction of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV), a subgroup with increasing incidence in several western countries. METHODS: As part of the HPV-AHEAD study, we assessed the role of HPV infection in 772 archived tissue specimens of Belgian HNC patients: 455 laryngeal (LC), 106 oral cavity (OCC), 99 OPC, 76 hypopharyngeal (HC), and 36 unspecified parts of the head and neck. All specimens were tested for HPV DNA (21 genotypes); whereof all HPV DNA-positives, all HPV DNA-negative OPCs and a random subset of HPV DNA-negatives of the other HNC-sites were tested for the presence of type-specific HPV RNA and p16(INK4a) over-expression. RESULTS: The highest HPV DNA prevalence was observed in OPC (36.4 %), and was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the other HNCs (OCC:7.5 %, LC:6.6 %). HPV16 was the most common HPV-genotype in all HNCs. Approximately 83.0 % of the HPV DNA-positive OPCs tested HPV RNA or p16-positive, compared to about 37.5 % and 44.0 % in OCC and LC, respectively. Estimation of the attributable fraction of an HPV infection in HNC was very similar for HPV RNA or p16 in addition to DNA-positivity; with 30 % for OPC, and 3 % for OCC and LC. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the heterogeneity of HPV DNA prevalence across anatomical sites in HNC, with a predominance of HPV16 in all sites. The estimated proportion of HPV-driven HNC in Belgium, during the period 1980-2014, was 10 times higher in OPC compared to OCC and LC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some countries have implemented stand-alone human papillomavirus (HPV) testing while others consider cotesting for cervical cancer screening. We compared both strategies within a population-based study. METHODS: The MARZY cohort study was conducted in Germany. Randomly selected women from population registries aged >/=30 years (n = 5,275) were invited to screening with Pap smear, liquid-based cytology (LBC, ThinPrep), and HPV testing (Hybrid Capture2, HC2). Screen-positive participants [ASC-US+ or high-risk HC2 (hrHC2)] and a random 5% sample of screen-negatives were referred to colposcopy. Post hoc HPV genotyping was conducted by GP5+/6+ PCR-EIA with reverse line blotting. Sensitivity, specificity (adjusted for verification bias), and potential harms, including number of colposcopies needed to detect 1 precancerous lesion (NNC), were calculated. RESULTS: In 2,627 screened women, cytological sensitivities (Pap, LBC: 47%) were lower than HC2 (95%) and PCR (79%) for CIN2+. Cotesting demonstrated higher sensitivities (HC2 cotesting: 99%; PCR cotesting: 84%), but at the cost of lower specificities (92%-95%) compared with HPV stand-alone (HC2: 95%; PCR: 94%) and cytology (97% or 99%). Cotesting versus HPV stand-alone showed equivalent relative sensitivity [HC2: 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.21; PCR: 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00-1.27]. Relative specificity of Pap cotesting with either HPV test was inferior to stand-alone HPV. LBC cotesting demonstrated equivalent specificity (both tests: 0.99, 95% CI, 0.99-1.00). NNC was highest for Pap cotesting. CONCLUSIONS: Cotesting offers no benefit in detection over stand-alone HPV testing, resulting in more false positive results and colposcopy referrals. IMPACT: HPV stand-alone screening offers a better balance of benefits and harms than cotesting.See related commentary by Wentzensen and Clarke, p. 432.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of pre-treatment primary tumor FDG-PET and DWI-MR imaging parameters in predicting HPV status and the second aim was to assess the feasibility of those imaging parameters to predict response to therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed primary tumors in 33 patients with proven OPSCC. PET/MRI was performed before and 6 months after chemo-radiotherapy for assessing treatment response. PET Standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from pre-treatment measurements were assessed and compared to the clinicopathological characteristics (T stages, N stages, tumor grades, HPV and post-treatment follow up). HPV was correlated to the clinicopathological characteristics. RESULTS: ADCmean was significantly lower in patients with HPV(+ve) than HPV(-ev), (P = 0.001), cut off value of (800 +/- 0.44*10(-3)mm(2)/s) with 76.9% sensitivity, and 72.2% specificity is able to differentiate between the two groups. No significant differences were found between FDG parameters (SUVmax, TLG, and MTV), and HPV status, (P = 0.873, P = 0.958, and P = 0.817), respectively. Comparison between CR and NCR groups; ADCmean, TLG, and MTV were predictive parameters of treatment response, (P = 0.017, P = 0.013, and P = 0.014), respectively. HPV(+ve) group shows a higher probability of lymph nodes involvement, (P = 0.006) CONCLUSION: Our study found that pretreatment ADC of the primary tumor can predict HPV status and treatment response. On the other hand, metabolic PET parameters (TLG, and MTV) were able to predict primary tumor response to therapy.

AB  - This single-center, retrospective cohort study sought to estimate the cumulative incidence in HIV-1-infected patients of biopsy-proven high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) recurrence after infrared coagulation (IRC) treatment. The study was based on data from a prospectively compiled database of 665 HIV-1-infected outpatients who attended a hospital Clinical Proctology/HIV Unit between January 2012 and December 2015. Patient records were checked to see which ones had received IRC treatment but later experienced a recurrence of HGAIN. Cytology samples were also checked for the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV). A total of 81 of the 665 patients (12%, 95%CI: 10-15%), of whom 65 were men and 16 women, were diagnosed with HGAIN and again treated with IRC. Of these 81, 20 (25%) experienced recurrent HGAIN, this incidence being true of both men (16/65, 95%CI: 19-57%) and women (4/16, 95%CI: 10-50%). The median time to recurrence was 6 (2-19) months overall, 6 (2-19) months in men, and 4 (2-6) months in women. HPV infection was detected in all patients except two, with HPV-16 being the most common genotype. This rate of incidence of recurrent HGAIN following IRC treatment is consistent with other reports and highlights the importance of continued post-treatment surveillance, particularly in the first year.

AB  - Despite a growing incidence in developed countries and a recent improved understanding of its pathogenesis, anal cancer management has not evolved over the past decades and drug combination used as first-line regimen still largely depends on clinician preferences. Aiming at paving the way for precision medicine, a large cohort of 372 HIV-negative patients diagnosed over a 20-year time period with locally advanced anal carcinoma was collected and carefully characterized at the clinical, demographic, histopathologic, immunologic, and virologic levels. Both the prognostic relevance of each clinicopathological parameter and the efficacy of different concurrent chemoradiation strategies were determined. Overall, the incidence of anal cancer peaked during the sixth decade (mean: 63.4) and females outnumbered males (ratio: 2.51). After completion of treatment, 95 (25.5%) patients experienced progression of persistent disease or local/distant recurrence and 102 (27.4%) died during the follow-up period (median: 53.8 months). Importantly, uni-multivariate analyses indicated that both negative HPV/p16(ink4a) status and aberrant p53 expression were far better predictors for reduced progression-free survival than traditional risk factors such as tumor size and nodal status. As for overall survival, the significant influences of age at diagnosis, p16(ink4a) status, cTNM classification as well as both CD3(+) and CD4(+) T-cell infiltrations within tumor microenvironment were highlighted. Cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy was superior to both radiotherapy alone and other concurrent chemoradiation therapies in the treatment of HPV-positive tumors. Regarding their HPV-uninfected counterparts, frequent relapses were observed, whatever the treatment regimen administered. Taken together, our findings reveal that current anal cancer management and treatment have reached their limits. A dualistic classification according to HPV/p53 status should be considered with implications for therapy personalization and optimization.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer screening can be conducted with cytology and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing but few studies have compared the latter directly to concomitant testing (co-testing). We compared these strategies to determine appropriate screening. Method(s): Within a randomised population-based cohort study conducted around Mainz, Germany, eligible women (>=30 years) were screened via Pap smear, liquid-based cytology (LBC) and HPV testing (HC2) and HPV genotyped post hoc (PCR). These tests formed three strategies: cytology (Pap or LBC) and HPV (HC2 or PCR) stand-alone and co-testing. Screen positives and 5% negative women were invited to colposcopy. Absolute and relative sensitivity, specificity, false positive rates (FPR) and number needed to colposcopy to detect one lesion (NNC) were calculated. Estimates were crude and verification bias-adjusted using stratified sampling with bootstrapped confidence intervals. Result(s): Of 2,627 screened women, cytology stand-alone demonstrated lowest sensitivities (47%) and highest specificities (97%- 99%) while HPV stand-alone demonstrated higher sensitivities (79%-95%) but lower specificities (94%-95%). Co-testing increased sensitivity (84%-99%) but not specificity (92%-95%). Relative sensitivities were similar between crude and adjusted estimates, with greater detection via HPV-based strategies. Specificity of co-testing with LBC relative to HPV stand-alone was near unity (0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00) but significantly lower than unity with Pap co-testing. FPR and NNC were greatest under co-testing. Conclusion(s): HPV stand-alone screening in women over 30 years appears appropriate over co-testing as a screening strategy. Key messages: Co-testing for cervical cancer does not appear to add any benefit in detection and may introduce unnecessary harms compared to HPV stand-alone screening.

AB  - Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) affects mainly males in 6th to 7th decade. Major extrinsic risk factors (RF) are alcohol, tobacco and HPV-infection. A small subset develops HNSCC at young age < 50years (y), often without established RF exposure. Telomere biology disorders (TBD) are characterized by impaired telomere maintenance and patients (pts) with TBD are predisposed to develop solid cancers typically arising at early age, amongst which HNSCC represent the most frequent entity. Premature shortened telomere length (TL) represents the functional read-out in TBD. We systematically analyzed TL in a young HNSCC patient cohort to identify so far unknown underlying TBD cases. Patients and Methods: For this respective sub-cohort, pts < 50y at initial HNSCC diagnosis and/or missing RF were eligible. All pts were included in the Aachen telomeropathy registry (ATR) based on clinical suspicion for TBD by the treating physician. Lymphocyte (L) and granulocyte (G) age-adjusted (aa) TL were analyzed by flow-FISH, next generation sequencing (NGS) for telomere maintenance gene mutations performed in cases with telomeres shortened below the 1st percentile. Result(s): Six German centers included 40 pts in this ongoing study. Mean age at initial tumor diagnosis was 42.0 +/- 7.2y. Major site and histology was oral tongue and SCC, respectively. Tumor stage and RF available in 29 pts showed 18 (62%) with initial stage III or IV, smoking in 13 (45%), alcohol abuse (>50g/day) in six (20%) and 10 (34%) with no history for both RF. HPV /p16 status was negative in all analyzed cases (15/15). AaTL in L was significantly lower (-0.59 (p= 0.017)) compared to healthy controls, while aaTL in G was normal (0.45 (p= 0,059)). The observed difference in L represents calculated approx. 10y of premature aging. TL was below the 1st percentile both in L and G in one patient. NGS screening revealed a homozygous gene mutation suspected to cause TBD. Conclusion(s): TL screening in young HNSCC pts can identify pts with underlying inherited TBD. Despite of so far relatively low frequency, proper TBD detection is of utmost importance because of expected excess radiation and/or chemotherapy toxicity. Furthermore, pre-aged lymphocytes could contribute to tumor development due to chronic inflammation or by being part of a deleterious microenvironment. Further studies are needed to address the role of premature TL shortening in the lymphocytes of this pre-selected group of HNSCC pts.

AB  - Introduction/Background* The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene, Qiagen, Hilden Germany) human papillomavirus (HPV) assay for the detection of cervical neoplasia compared to conventional cytology testing. Methodology Two hundred consecutive eligible women evaluated in the Outpatient department at the University Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Skopje aged 30-64 years, were informed and offered to be sampled with the HC2 test in addition to any tests ordered by their attending physician free of charge and strictly on voluntary basis. Written consent was obtained from all participating women. The attending physicians were blinded for the results of the HC2 tests and any and all medical decisions regarding patient evaluation/treatment were based on the cytology results. Result(s)* The average age of the women included was 44 +/-11 years, ranging from 30 to 64. A total of 200 cytology smears, 200 HC2 tests, 76 (38%) colposcopy examinations, 45 PCR (22.5%) based HPV tests and 50 (25%) cervical biopsies were performed. The detection rate for histology verified CIN2+ lesions for the HC2 based algorithm in the studied population, when compared with the conventional cytology-based algorithm was 19/22 (86.36%), while the detection rate for histology verified CIN3+ lesions was 14/ 14 (100%). The sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR- of the HC2 test in the detection of CIN2+ lesions were 88%, 87.5%, 7.04 and 0.13, respectively, giving the test an accuracy of 87.72%. Using the conventional cytology-based algorithm required 76 referrals for colposcopy, 45 referrals for PCR based HPV detection and 50 referrals for cervical biopsy, compared to 41 cytology test, 33 colposcopy referrals and 22 biopsy referrals. Conclusion* Implementing a HC2 based cervical cancer screening algorithm could potentially reduce the number of colposcopy/biopsy referrals by over 50% without a substantial impact on the CIN2+ detection rate and no impact on the CIN3+ detection rate. This in turn decreases the associated costs of screening, decreases the number of unnecessary diagnostic procedures and, could increases patient comfort, satisfaction and adherence to the screening program.

AB  - Background & objectives: 2020 the combined screening with HPV test and cytology for the early detection of cervical cancer was introduced in Germany. With a cytology finding of atypical squamous cells and a positive HPV test a diagnostic colposcopy should be carried out. Method(s): In 2020 total of 62557 Pap smears were cytological examined and HPV test was performed by using the HPV Aptima Test, which discriminated HPV 16, HPV 18/45 and other types (16,18,31, 33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,66,68). After diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and positive HPV test colposcopy in a specialized centre within 3 months were recommended. Result(s): In 2352 women (3,8 %) ASC-US were diagnosed and in 1017 cases a HPV positivity was found. In 110 Cases (11 %) HPV 16 were detected, in 92 cases (9%) HPV 18/45 were detected and in 815 cases (80%) other types were detected. In 383 cases a colposcopy were performed and reported. In 272 cases (71 %) no essential lesion were detected and in 68 cases (18%) a low grade intraepithelial lesion (SIL) were diagnosed. In 43 cases (11%) a high grade SIL were diagnosed. No invasive cancer were found. Conclusion(s): In the first year of the combined German screening we detected 1017 (1,6%) women with HPV positivity and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). After performing colposcopy 71 % of these women were inconspicuous and in 29 % intraepithelial neoplasia were detected. In 18%LSIL and in 11%HSIL were histological diagnosed. No invasive cancer was found. These data seems to be an expression of the importance of HPV positivity in ASC-US by detecting cervical lesions.

AB  - Introduction The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer attributable to human papillomaviruses (HPV-OPC) has been rising constantly over the last decades. How oral HPV infections progress into cancer is poorly understood due to the lack of detectable precancerous lesions, making early detection of HPV-OPC difficult. Antibodies to HPV16 early proteins, especially E6, are strongly associated with incident but also prospective HPV-OPSCC. Within a prospective epidemiological cohort, we analyzed HPV16 serum antibodies to identify patients at high risk for HPV-driven OPC. Patients and Methods The study is embedded within the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS), a single center, prospective, epidemiologic cohort study that started enrolling 45.000 participants (45-74 years) in 2015. We analyzed HPV16 serum antibodies to identify individuals at high risk for HPV-OPC. The first 4,460 participants' sera were screened for HPV16 E6, E1, E2 and E7 antibodies using multiplex serology. Results Of these participants, 36 (0.8%) were HPV16 E6 seropositive including 12 (0.3%) seropositive for at least one additional HPV16 early protein. These individuals were considered at high risk for HPV-OPC, and re-contacted for head and neck examination. Until now, 3 of the 12 participants were identified with asymptomatic HPV-OPC in our follow-up. Of the remaining 9 individuals with high-risk HPV-OPC antibody profile, 7 were free of detectable symptoms and undergo regular follow-up every 6 months. 2 other individuals were lost to follow-up. Conclusion Detection of HPV16 early antibodies might be an innovative method to identify asymptomatic HPV-OPC patients at an early stage, and may reduce morbidity and improve survival.

AB  - Background: A new nationwide screening strategy was implemented in Germany in January 2020. No data are available for women referred to certified dysplasia units for secondary clarification after primary diagnosis by a local physician. We therefore investigated combined testing with Papanicolaou smears and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) and compared the data with the final histological findings. Methods: Between January 2015 and October 2020, all referred women who underwent colposcopy of the uterine cervix in our certified dysplasia unit were included. Cytology findings were classified using the Munich III nomenclature. Results: A total of 3588 colposcopies were performed in 3118 women, along with Pap smear and hrHPV co-testing, followed by histology. Women with Pap II-p (ASC-US) and a positive hrHPV co-test had a 22.4% risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The risk of CIN 3/HSIL was 83.8% in women with Pap IVa-p (HSIL) and a positive hrHPV co-test. A positive hrHPV co-test increased the risk for HSIL+ (OR 5.942; 95% CI, 4.617 to 7.649; p < 0.001) as compared to a negative hrHPV co-test. Conclusions: The accuracy of Pap smears is comparable with the screening results. A positive hrHPV test increases the risk for HSIL+ fivefold. Colposcopy is necessary to diagnose HSIL+ correctly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 3) still develops in some vaccinated women despite established effectiveness of prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The purpose of this study was to define characteristics of women with CIN 3 after HPV vaccination referred to a gynecological dysplasia unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of HPV-vaccinated women with CIN 3 in a single German center. Between July 2018 and September 2020, 791 women were referred to our university hospital-based dysplasia unit for colposcopic evaluation of abnormal cytological findings. Human papillomavirus vaccination status was retrieved. Human papillomavirus typing was performed in lesional biopsies and cervical swabs. RESULTS: Nine women were identified who had previously been vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Q-HPV) and were diagnosed with histologically confirmed CIN 3/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. The Q-HPV had been administered between 12 and 28 years of age and 1-13 years before CIN 3 diagnosis. Nine different high-risk (HR)-HPV types were found in the CIN 3 biopsies, 6 monoinfections (twice HPV 16, once HPV 18, HPV 31, HPV 52, HPV 58, respectively) and 3 dual infections (HPV 33 + 52, HPV 51 + 52, HPV 53 + 66). Seven of these 9 HR-HPV types are not covered by Q-HPV, but only 2 CIN 3 lesions carried HR-HPV types not included in the nonavalent HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to implement vaccination recommendations and administer HPV vaccination as early as possible in HPV-naive individuals. Because not all HR-HPV types are covered by the available HPV vaccines, other types may still cause CIN 3/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. This requires further screening after vaccination, especially in women who were previously vaccinated with the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.

AB  - Background: In 2020 guidelines for an organized screening program for cervical cancer with changes in primary screening and clinical management of conspicuous findings were introduced in Germany. Objective(s): Due to the data deficit, which stems from the central documentation only beginning after a 9-month delay, the results of the complete first screening round from a routine laboratory are evaluated. Material: In 2020 all co-test results of women aged 35 years and over were recorded in a pathology practice. The cytological control findings, human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, colposcopy and histological findings were documented. Result(s): In the primary screening a co-test was carried out for 63,615 women. Cytology findings requiring clarification by colposcopy (groups IIp-V of the Munich nomenclature III) were found in 1.96% and the HPV positive rate was 5.82% (1.28% HPV 16, 0.42% HPV 18). When cytologically negative and HPV positive women were examined by the required co-test 12 months later, these findings persisted in 40.6%, in 19.7% positive cytology findings were found. For 973 of the 1378 women positive for co-test, the results of colposcopy are known: 10.2% cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 7.8% CIN2, 8.5% CIN3 and 0.21% carcinoma. Of the 1081 women with positive cytology findings in primary screening 979 underwent colposcopy and 19.9% CIN1, 17% CIN2, 25.1% CIN3, 0.41% adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and 1.43% invasive carcinoma were diagnosed. Referral for colposcopy solely on persistent positive HPV test yielded CIN3 in 3.6% and for low-risk cytology a total of 6.6%. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate an unfavorable benefit-cost ratio for negative and low-risk cytology. The central program evaluation will show to what extent algorithms should be adapted.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Penile squamous cell carcinomas (PSCC) are classified by the World Health Organization into two categories based on their relationship with the human papillomavirus (HPV): HPV-associated and HPV-independent. We compared a cohort of PSCC from Mozambique, a sub-Saharan country in southeast Africa with a high prevalence of HPV and HIV infection, and Spain, a country in southwestern Europe with a low prevalence of HPV and HIV, to study the distribution of the etiopathogenic categories of these tumors in both sites. A total of 79 PSCC were included in the study (28 from Mozambique and 51 from Spain). All cases underwent HPV-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, genotyping, and immunohistochemistry for p16 and p53. Any PSCC showing either p16 overexpression or HPV-DNA in PCR analysis was considered HPV-associated. Overall, 40/79 (50.6%) tumors were classified as HPV-associated and 39 (49.4%) as HPV-independent. The two sites showed marked differences: 25/28 (89.3%) tumors from Mozambique and only 15/51 (29.4%) from Spain were HPV-associated (p < 0.001). HPV16 was the most frequent HPV type identified in 64.0% (16/25) of the HPV-associated tumors from Mozambique, and 60.0% (9/15) from Spain (p = 0.8). On average, patients from Mozambique were almost two decades younger than those from Spain (mean age 50.9 +/- 14.9 and 69.2 +/- 13.3, respectively [p < 0.001]). In conclusion, significant etiopathogenic differences between PSCC in Mozambique and Spain were observed, with a remarkably high prevalence of HPV-associated tumors in Mozambique and a relatively low prevalence in Spain. These data may have important consequences for primary prevention of PSCC worldwide.

AB  - Detection of p16 through immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard for determining the HPV status of the tumor according the TNM eighth edition released in 2017 and has become crucial for determining the HPV status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) with direct impact on staging and prognostication. In recent years, detection of HPV DNA in mouthwashes has been proposed as a noninvasive alternative, both for OPSCCs and for other head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). However, the prospect of using the mouthwashes to monitor the response to therapy is unclear. To evaluate the effect of curative therapy on the detection of HPV DNA, we performed a prospective study comparing the detection frequency of high-risk HPV DNA (HR-HPV-DNA) in pre- and post-therapy mouthwashes. We collected 137 mouthwashes from 88 pathologically confirmed HNSCC patients for DNA isolation and HPV genotyping with the Inno-LiPA assay. We show that HPV DNA in pretherapeutic mouthwashes can detect HPV-driven HNSCCs with a sensitivity of 50.0% and specificity of 85.4%, alongside a high negative predictive value of 79.5% and an accuracy of 74.5%. Furthermore, we observed a notable decrease in the detection frequency of HR-HPV-DNA after successful treatment (pre-therapy 50.0% (9/18) versus post-therapy 9.7% (3/28)). However, the comparatively low sensitivity regarding detection of HPV-driven OPSCC argues against its use in clinical routine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The lack of detectable precancerous lesions poses challenges to the early detection of human papillomavirus-driven oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC). Antibodies against HPV16 early proteins, especially E6, are uniquely sensitive and specific biomarkers detectable years prior to HPV-OPC diagnosis. Thus, HPV16 early protein serology warrants clinical investigation for HPV-OPC screening. METHODS: Using multiplex serology, we analyzed HPV16 serum antibodies of the first 5000 participants (n=4,424 sera, recruited 2016-2017) of the Hamburg City Health Study, a population-based prospective cohort (45-74 years). Participants seropositive for HPV16 E6 and at least one additional early protein (E1, E2, E7) were considered at high risk for HPV-OPC development and invited to six-monthly non-invasive head and neck follow-up (FU) examinations (visual inspection, endoscopy, ultrasonography, performed 2019-2020). Participants with suspicious lesions were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and panendoscopy with biopsy. Histologically confirmed OPC cases were treated according to standard of care. FINDINGS: In total, 35 out of 4,424 study participants (0.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-1.1%) were HPV16 E6 seropositive. Among these, eleven (0.3%, 95%CI 0.1-0.5%) were considered at high risk for HPV-OPC of which nine were successfully re-contacted and invited to regular clinical FU examinations. Two males and one female were diagnosed with stage I HPV-OPC within 1.3 years of clinical FU (3-4 years after initial blood draw), representing one diagnosis of prevalent advanced disease, one incident diagnosis of advanced disease, and one incident diagnosis of early disease. The remaining participants showed no detectable signs of cancer, and undergo regular examinations (median clinical FU: 1.0 years, median total FU from blood draw to last clinical FU visit: 4.7 years). INTERPRETATION: HPV16 early antibodies allowed identifying three asymptomatic stage I HPV-OPC patients, out of eleven participants considered at high risk. However, two of the three cases already showed signs of advanced disease at diagnosis. Targeting multiple early proteins may considerably improve the positive predictive value of HPV16 serology and may have clinical utility for HPV-OPC screening. FUNDING: This work was funded by DKFZ and UKE intramural funding.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) generally have a more favourable prognosis. We hypothesized that HPV-associated HNSCC may be identified by an miRNA-signature according to their specific molecular pathogenesis, and be characterized by a unique transcriptome compared to HPV-negative HNSCC. We performed miRNA expression profiling of two p16/HPV DNA characterized HNSCC cohorts of patients treated by adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy (multicentre DKTK-ROG n = 128, single-centre LMU-KKG n = 101). A linear model predicting HPV status built in DKTK-ROG using lasso-regression was tested in LMU-KKG. LMU-KKG tumours (n = 30) were transcriptome profiled for differential gene expression and miRNA-integration. A 24-miRNA signature predicted HPV-status with 94.53% accuracy (AUC: 0.99) in DKTK-ROG, and 86.14% (AUC: 0.86) in LMU-KKG. The prognostic values of 24-miRNA- and p16/HPV DNA status were comparable. Combining p16/HPV DNA and 24-miRNA status allowed patient sub-stratification and identification of an HPV-associated patient subgroup with impaired overall survival. HPV-positive tumours showed downregulated MAPK, Estrogen, EGFR, TGFbeta, WNT signaling activity. miRNA-mRNA integration revealed HPV-specific signaling pathway regulation, including PD-L1 expression/PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer in HPV-associated HNSCC. Integration of clinically established p16/HPV DNA with 24-miRNA signature status improved clinically relevant risk stratification, which might be considered for future clinical decision-making with respect to treatment de-escalation in HPV-associated HNSCC.

AB  - The world health organization (WHO) called for coordinated global action in 2018 to eliminate cervical cancer, ensuring that every woman is screened and treated for precancerous lesions (World Health Organization. Cervical cancer: an NCD we can overcome. Geneva, 2018. http://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/cervical-cancer-an-ncd-we-can-overcome.tegy ). Cytology-based screening has been for decades the conventional method of screening. Ancillary techniques have been added like immunocytochemistry with P16/Ki67 and L1-Capsid, but these methods require maintenance of complex infrastructure and highly trained personnel as well as relatively short screening intervals. HPV-based screening method to detect high-risk groups is a faster and automated method, which does not need morphologically highly qualified personal with high social costs. In the study, we have focused on the distribution of cervical lesions in the age groups with concordance of detection HPV high-risk subtypes (HPV-HR) and on the safety of the screening method. In the Institute for Pathology and Cytology-Schuettorf-Leer-Germany 146.800 samples of women from the age of and above 35 years were analyzed between the beginnings of 2020 until the beginning of 2021. 63.710 cases under 35 years old were analyzed. The samples were processed for both conventional cytological techniques and for molecular detection and subtyping of HPV-HR according to the advice and measurements of BD-manufacture. In this study, we have studied the histopathological results (Table 2) after colposcopy according to the age subgroups. The histopathological results were subdivided into no dysplasia, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (CIN I), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II (CIN II), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III (CIN III), squamous cell carcinoma (Sq.c.c), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), endometrial carcinoma, endocervical adenocarcinoma and cases without biopsy during the colposcopy (COB). We have used the muenchener classification III (Table 3) as a subgrading system for the cytological specimens. The frequency of detecting HPV56/59/66 is higher as detecting HPV-16 and HPV18 in age groups under 35 years old, 41-50 years old and 51-60 years old. HPV16 is detected higher in age groups 35-40 years old and above 60 years. The incidence of high squamous intraepithelial lesions (CIN II and III) is 0.92% in age group 35-40 years, 0.54% in age under 35 years, 0.59% in age group 41-50 years old, 0.35% in age group 51-60 years old and 0.15% in age group above 60 years old. There is no significance (p value = 0.4060). Low grade cervical lesions (CIN I) were 0.13% (< 35 Ys), 0.35% (35-40 Ys), 0.36% (41-50 Ys), 0.25% (51-60 Ys) and 0.098% (> 60Y s), which was statistically significant (p value = 0.04,0.60). Without dysplasia 0.19% (< 35 Ys), 0.5% (35-40 Ys), 0.56% (41-50 Ys), 0.51 (51-60 Ys) and 0.26% (> 60 Ys). There is no significance between occurrence of cervical dysplasia and without dysplasia despite of detection of HPV-HR subtypes (p value = 0.1754). The only use of HPV-subtyping is not a secure method and a protective way for women. There are worldwide many HPV-positive cases, which have been psychologically impaired with higher costs, although they have no cervical epithelial changes during the HPV-infection. There are many HPV-negative cases, in some studies up to 13% of cases, which develop cervical cancer. We have the opinion and are convinced that the screening should be both morphologically via cytological examination and may be with adding immunocytochemistry to detect the really dysplastic cervical lesions. HPV-subtyping may be added every three years to detect the concomitant subtype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the regression rate of CIN2 p16 positive lesions in women over 25 years of age and identify possible predictors of regression. METHODS: A total of 128 CIN2 p16 positive patients over 25 years old were considered. The women met the following inclusion criteria: HPV genotype 16, 18, 31, 33, 45 positive, HPV E6 / E7 mRNA test positive, without immune system pathologies, not pregnant and had completed at least two years of follow-up. At each follow-up examination patients were examined by colposcopy, HPV test, E6/E7mRNA, targeted biopsy and p16 protein detection. The final state after the two years of follow-up was classified as progression if the histology showed a CIN3, persistence if the lesion was a CIN2, regression if negative or LSIL. The predicted regression factors evaluated were: HPV E6/E7mRNA, protein p16. RESULTS: Overall, we had 35.1% (45 cases) of progression to CIN3, 41.4% (53 cases) of persistence and 23.4% (30 cases) of regression. The regression rate was higher in women with negative mRNA 92.8% (26/28), OR 312 (34.12-1798.76) p = 0.0001, while women with p16 negative had a regression of 22.6% (7/31), OR 0.94 (95% CI 0.36-2.46), p was not significant. We found no significant difference in regression between p16 positive (23.7%) and p16 negative (22.6%) CIN2 p16 lesions. p16 had a VPN of 22.6 (CI 95% 0.159-0.310), indicating that a p16 negative lesion does not exclude a CIN2 + . CONCLUSIONS: We had a regression rate of 23.4%, which was low if we consider that in the literature the regression rates vary from 55 to 63%. The discrepancy in the results may indeed be explained by the fact that all lesions in our study were hr-HPV positive and belonged to "older women" reflecting a more "high-risk" population. As regression factors we studied p16 and HPV E6/E7 mRNA. The results of our study show that HPV mRNA, if negative, appears to be able to identify CIN2 lesions with a higher probability of regression and underlines how a p16 negative is not an indicator of regression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy and fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. More than 99.7% of cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), while HPV types 16 and 18 cause over 70% of all cervical cancer cases. In this preliminary study, we aimed to investigate the presence of HPV infection and diversity of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis. METHODS: Cervical swabs (n = 21) taken from women aged 21-47 years, in seventeen cases, with different degrees of cervical abnormality, and from four healthy women, were tested for the presence of HPV DNA, as well as the bacterial strains associated with bacterial vaginosis, using the real-time PCR method. RESULTS: HPV16 was the dominant genotype in 53% (9/17) of patients with confirmed precancerous lesions (ASCUS, LSIL, and HSIL). In specimens with confirmed cytological abnormalities and hrHPV infection, we detected a wide diversity of microbes, while the most common species were Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella bivia, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Leptotrichia amnionii, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Sneathia sanguinegens. The presence of pathogens did not differ, depending on the degree of precancerous lesions or HPV type. CONCLUSION: In our work, HPV16 dominated in patients with cervical precancerous lesions. We also suggest an increased bacterial diversity of the vaginal microbiome in patients with cervical lesions, for which the HPV virus is largely responsible.

AB  - Currently, no established biomarkers are recommended for the routine diagnosis of penile carcinoma (PeCa). The rising incidence of this human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancer entity highlights the need for promising candidates. The Calprotectin subunits S100A8 and S100A9 mark myeloid-derived suppressor cells in other HPV-related entities while their receptor CD147 was discussed to identify patients with PeCa at a higher risk for poor prognoses and treatment failure. We thus examined their expression using immunohistochemistry staining of PeCa specimens from 74 patients on tissue microarrays of the tumor center, the invasion front, and lymph node metastases. Notably, whereas the tumor center was significantly more intensively stained than the invasion front, lymph node metastases were thoroughly positive for both S100 subunits. An HPV-positive status combined with an S100A8(+)S100A9(+) profile was related with an elevated risk for metastases. We observed several PeCa specimens with S100A8(+)S100A9(+)-infiltrating immune cells overlapping with CD15 marking neutrophils. The S100A8(+)S100A9(+)CD15(+) profile was associated with dedifferentiated and metastasizing PeCa, predominantly of HPV-associated subtype. These data suggest a contribution of neutrophil-derived suppressor cells to the progression of HPV-driven penile carcinogenesis. CD147 was elevated, expressed in PeCa specimens, prominently at the tumor center and in HPV-positive PeCa cell lines. CD147(+)HPV(+) PeCa specimens were with the higher-frequency metastasizing cancers. Moreover, an elevated expression of CD147 of HPV-positive PeCa cell lines correlated negatively with the susceptibility to IgA-based neutrophil-mediated tumor cell killing. Finally, stratifying patients regarding their HPV/S100A8/S100A9/CD15/CD147 profile may help identify patients with progressing cancer and tailor immunotherapeutic treatment strategies.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) circulating tumor DNA (HPV ctDNA) was proposed as a biomarker for the detection and disease monitoring of HPV-related cancers. One hundred eighty plasma samples obtained from women diagnosed with HPV16-positive cervical cancer (CC) (n = 100), HPV16-positive premalignant lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 [CIN3]) (n = 20), and HPV DNA-negative controls (n = 60) were randomly selected from the archives for evaluating the performance of a bead-based HPV genotyping assay (E7 type-specific multiplex genotyping assay [E7-MPG]) in detecting HPV16 ctDNA. The performance of the E7-MPG was compared with those of DNA detection by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and detection of HPV16 E6 antibodies evaluated in an independent study. Internal controls to assess DNA quality were included in the molecular assays, i.e., beta-globin and ESR1, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of E7-MPG and/or E6 antibodies to detect HPV16-positive CCs were evaluated. HPV16 ctDNA was detected using the E7-MPG in 42.3% of all plasma samples and in 74.7% of plasma samples from HPV16-positive CC cases. The validation of E7-MPG data by ddPCR showed that the sensitivity of the E7-MPG test for HPV16-positive CC detection was higher than that of ddPCR (74.7% versus 63.1%; P < 0.001). When both HPV16 ctDNA and E6 antibodies were considered, the sensitivity for HPV16-positive CC detection increased from 74.7% to 86.1%, while the specificity was unchanged at 97.8%. The performance of E7-MPG for the detection of HPV16 ctDNA appears to be at least as sensitive as that of ddPCR, offering an additional tool for ctDNA detection of HPV16-positive CC. The use of an additional blood marker of HPV infection, such as E6 antibodies, further improved the detection of CC. IMPORTANCE The validity of HPV ctDNA as a marker of HPV-driven cancers has been previously reported. Herein we validated an alternative to ddPCR for HPV16 ctDNA detection, using a bead-based HPV genotyping assay that offers the potential advantage of reducing the cost of clinical management due to the multiplex capability of the test, thus facilitating its use in clinical settings. In addition, we analyzed HPV ctDNA in the context of E6 antibodies as an additional HPV marker. The HPV16 ctDNA biomarker appeared to be highly specific and, to a lesser extent, sensitive for the detection of CC, mainly indicated for those at an advanced tumor stage. In this proof-of-principle study, E6 antibodies were mainly detected in early tumor stages of CC, while HPV ctDNA was mainly positive at advanced tumor stages.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with both benign lesions and with neoplastic diseases, such as oropharyngeal cancer. Due to the increasing occurrence of these neoplasms on a global scale, it seems important to estimate the risk factors in the population. So far, data on the presence of oral HPV in the European population are scarce. Oral HPV was detected in 53 out of 461 healthy subjects (11.5%) in south-eastern Poland. Among the most common oncogenic types, HPV 16 was reported in four subjects (0.87%) and HPV 18 in three subjects (0.65%). Another high-risk type, HPV 45, was detected in nine subjects (1.95%). Low risk types (HPV 6, 11, 54) were detected in 25 cases, which constituted 5.4% of all tested samples. In adults and children, statistically more HPV positive cases have been reported in males than in females. A positive relationship was demonstrated between age and the amount of positive oral HPV. The presence of HPV was statistically more frequent in the population living in urban rather than in rural areas in all studied age groups (p < 0.05).

AB  - Circulating cell-free HPV DNA (ccfHPV DNA) may serve as a marker for cervical cancer. In this study, we used digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to detect and quantify ccfHPV DNA in plasma from patients with HPV16- or HPV18-associated cervical cancer. Blood samples from 60 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer (FIGO IA1-IVA) at Aarhus or Odense University Hospital (June 2018 to March 2020) were collected prior to treatment, and patients were subdivided into an early stage (n = 30) and a late-stage subgroup (n = 30) according to disease stage. Furthermore, blood samples from eight women with HPV16- or 18-associated premalignant conditions (CIN3), and 15 healthy controls were collected. ddPCR was used to analyze plasma from all participants. ccfHPV DNA was detected in 19 late-stage patients (63.33%), 3 early stage patients (10.00%), and none of the CIN3 patients or controls. Quantitative evaluation showed significant correlations between ccfHPV DNA level and stage, tumor score, and tumor size. Thus, our results indicate that ccfHPV DNA may not be a useful marker for early detection of cervical cancer. However, for patients with advanced stage cervical cancer, ccfHPV DNA level represents a promising tool to establish tumor burden, making it useful for establishing treatment response and monitoring the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women living with HIV have an increased risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer. Little is known about genotype-specific HPV prevalence, the impact of antiretroviral therapy, immunological status, and additional risk factors in women living with HIV in Germany. The goal of this study was to characterize the risk profile for cervical dysplasia in these women. METHODS: Patients with HIV infection presenting at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin from October 2017 to September 2020 were included and underwent gynecological examination, colposcopy, cervical cytology and HPV genotype testing. HPV genotypes were stratified by carcinogenicity. Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or higher were considered abnormal cytology. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 26, 2019). A two-tailed p-value </=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 84 women were evaluated. The majority (95.2%) received antiretroviral therapy. Median CD4 cell count was 564 cells/microl (range 20-1969). 95.2% were previously screened for cervical cancer. High-risk HPV prevalence was 44%. High-high-risk HPV subtypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) were significantly associated with abnormal cytology (p<0.001). HPV16 was the most common genotype (23%), was significantly associated with abnormal cytology (p=0.002) and was the main risk factor for abnormal cytology (OR 8.55, 95% CI 2.15 to 34.13, p=0.002), followed by age <35 years (OR 4.96, 95% CI 1.23 to 19.61, p=0.033) and cigarette smoking (OR 3.944, 95% CI 0.98 to 15.88, p=0.053). CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral therapy and adherence to cervical cancer screening was high. High-high-risk HPV, especially HPV16, coincided with high incidence of cytological abnormalities. Women living with HIV in Germany have adequate immune status and are often pre-screened for cervical cancer, and therefore have a different risk profile for cervical dysplasia than in low-income or medium-income countries. Adapted screening programs should be defined.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women worldwide. Conventional cytological examination as a screening method with Papanicolaou has been established to reduce the incidence of dysplasia and cervical cancer for years. In addition to the conventional screening, the introduction of immunocytochemical examinations, including CINtecPlus and L1-capsid, has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on screening results. In addition to morphological screening methods, human papillomavirus (HPV)-testing has also been demonstrated to possess an enormous potential in the cervical screening process. Additionally, different screening models ranging from conventional cytological screening to primary HPV-testing do exist in different countries. At the beginning of the year 2020, a combination of cytological screening and HPV-testing was introduced in Germany for women >/=35 years. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of morphological screening, including immunocytochemistry, and to compare it with HPV-genotyping. Immunocytochemistry was added to confirm the diagnosis but needs established infrastructure and well-trained personnel. Furthermore, there was a need to establish the HPV-screening method. In the Institute for Pathology and Cytology (Schuettorf, Leer, Germany), 146,800 samples of women (>35 years old) were examined between January 2020 and January 2021. The present study retrospectively analyzed 146,800 samples. Each sample was examined using a conventional cytological technique and HPV-high risk-Test (HPV-HR-Test) with Viper-BD. Immunocytochemistry with CINtecPlus and L1-capsid was added in some cases. A total of 555 cases were cytological diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US; IIp). After performing immunocytochemistry, 79% of cases were suspected to be positive and 1.48% of cases were definitely positive. The HPV-HR-Test was positive in 26.4% of cases. Among cases of ASC-US and HPV-HR-negativity, 33.7% were suspicious of immunocytochemical positivity and 0.5% were definitely positive. Among patients with HPV-16-negativity, 13.6% were patients with highly squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 22.7% were patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and HSIL. Among patients with HPV-18-negativity, 14.3% were patients with HSIL and 19.5% were patients with LSIL and HSIL. There were 107 cases in this group of cases with negativity of both HPV-16 and HPV-18. After performing the colposcopy and biopsy, there were 6.5% with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 8.4% with CIN II and 5.6% with CIN III. In conclusion, there is still a need for conventional cytological examination and maybe the addition of immunocytochemistry to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude dysplasia of cervical epithelium. The HPV-HR-Test is not enough as a screening method and may be misleading.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) represent a distinct clinical entity compared with HPV-negative tumors with particular regard to treatment response and survival outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the AmpFire Multiplex HR-HPV tests, for the detection and genotyping of 15 high-risk (HR) HPV types in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and identify HPV-driven OPSCC. DNA from 160 OPSCC FFPE specimens plus 23 samples from other head and neck primary sites was tested. Results were compared with those obtained using Linear Array HPV-DNA Genotyping Test. Linear Array and AmpFire Multiplex HR-HPV tests showed, for all samples and specifically for OPSCCs, an overall concordance agreement of 98.9% and 99.4% and a Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.972 and 0.984, respectively. A concordance of 100% for HPV16 and HPV18 was observed. The overall agreement between p16(INK4a) overexpression and HPV detection by the AmpFire Multiplex HR-HPV assay in 145 OPSCC samples was 93.8%, with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.848. The AmpFire HPV Tests are simple assays for detection and genotyping of HPV-DNA in OPSCC FFPE samples and can be easily implemented in the clinical practice setting for HPV-DNA detection.

AB  - Biomarkers with relevance for loco-regional therapy are needed in human papillomavirus negative aka HPV(-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on the premise that DNA methylation pattern is highly conserved, we sought to develop a reliable and robust methylome-based classifier identifying HPV(-) HNSCC patients at risk for loco-regional recurrence (LR) and all-event progression after postoperative radiochemotherapy (PORT-C). The training cohort consisted of HPV-DNA negative HNSCC patients (n = 128) homogeneously treated with PORT-C in frame of the German Cancer Consortium-Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) multicenter biomarker trial. DNA Methylation analysis was performed using Illumina 450 K and 850 K-EPIC microarray technology. The performance of the classifier was integrated with a series of biomarkers studied in the training set namely hypoxia-, 5-microRNA (5-miR), stem-cell gene-expression signatures and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based immunological characterization of tumors (CD3/CD8/PD-L1/PD1). Validation occurred in an independent cohort of HPV(-) HNSCC patients, pooled from two German centers (n = 125). We identified a 38-methylation probe-based HPV(-) Independent Classifier of disease Recurrence (HICR) with high prognostic value for LR, distant metastasis and overall survival (P < 10(-9) ). HICR remained significant after multivariate analysis adjusting for anatomical site, lymph node extracapsular extension (ECE) and size (T-stage). HICR high-risk tumors were enriched for younger patients with hypoxic tumors (15-gene signature) and elevated 5-miR score. After adjustment for hypoxia and 5-miR covariates, HICR maintained predicting all endpoints. HICR provides a novel mean for assessing the risk of LR in HPV(-) HNSCC patients treated with PORT-C and opens a new opportunity for biomarker-assisted stratification and therapy adaptation in these patients.

AB  - Whereas the lack of biomarkers in penile cancer (PeCa) impedes the development of efficacious treatment protocols, preliminary evidence suggests that c-MET and associated signaling elements may be dysregulated in this disorder. In the following study, we investigated whether c-MET and associated key molecular elements may have prognostic and therapeutic utility in PeCa. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from therapy-naive patients with invasive PeCa was used for tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the expression of the proteins c-MET, PPARg, beta-catenin, snail, survivin, and n-MYC. In total, 94 PeCa patients with available tumor tissue were included. The median age was 64.9 years. High-grade tumors were present in 23.4%, and high-risk HPV was detected in 25.5%. The median follow-up was 32.5 months. High expression of snail was associated with HPV-positive tumors. Expression of beta-catenin was inversely associated with grading. In both univariate COX regression analysis and the log-rank test, an increased expression of PPARg and c-MET was predictive of inferior disease-specific survival (DSS). Moreover, in multivariate analysis, a higher expression of c-MET was independently associated with worse DSS. Blocking c-MET with cabozantinib and tivantinib induced a significant decrease in viability in the primary PeCa cell line UKF-PeC3 isolated from the tumor tissue as well as in cisplatin- and osimertinib-resistant sublines. Strikingly, a higher sensitivity to tivantinib could be detected in the latter, pointing to the promising option of utilizing this agent in the second-line treatment setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of quality of life (QoL), nutritional and clinical indicators on overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) undergoing (chemo)radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the beginning, at the end of (chemo)radiotherapy and during follow-up, QoL was prospectively assessed using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and -QLQ-H&N35 questionnaires. Data were analyzed in 58 out of 220 screened patients, who were randomized into a control and intervention group. All patients received a nutritional assessment including bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), laboratory testing, and a screening for malnutrition based on the questionnaires MUST, NRS-2002 and Nutriscore at baseline and at the end of therapy. The intervention consisted of an individualized nutritional counseling every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Except for emotional functioning, dyspnea, financial difficulties, dental problems and weight gain, all other scales from the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and -H&N35 deteriorated during (chemo)radiotherapy. At first follow-up, patients of the control group experienced more nausea and vomiting compared to those of the intervention group (p = 0.02). After performing a multivariable model, dental problems at the end of therapy (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1-1.06; p = 0.03), HPV negativity (HR: 18.19, 95% CI: 1.61-204.17; p = 0.02), and baseline phase angle (HR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.82; p = 0.03) were identified as predictors for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Factors influencing overall survival in patients with HNSCC undergoing (chemo)radiotherapy are complex and multifactorial. We were able to identify QoL-related (dental problems), clinical (HPV status) and nutritional (phase angle) factors as negative predictors for survival. This study was registered within the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00016862).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is performed in cervival cancer and is required for classification of some head and neck cancers. In penile cancer a statement on HPV association of the carcinoma is required. In most cases p16 immunohistochemistry as a surrogate marker is applied in this setting. Since differing clinical outcomes for HPV positive and HPV negative tumors are described we await HPV testing to be requested more frequently by clinicians, also in the context of HPV vaccination, where other HPV subtypes are expected to emerge. METHOD: Therefore, a cohort of archived, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) penile neoplasias was stained for p16 and thereafter tested for HPV infection status via PCR based methods. Additionally to Sanger sequencing, we chose LCD-Array technique (HPV 3.5 LCD-Array Kit, Chipron; LCD-Array) for the detection of HPV in our probes expecting a less time consuming and sensitive HPV test for our probes. RESULTS: We found that LCD-Array is a sensitive and feasible method for HPV testing in routine diagnostics applicable to FFPE material in our cohort. Our cohort of penile carcinomas and carcinomas in situ was associated with HPV infection in 61% of cases. We detected no significant association between HPV infection status and histomorphological tumor characteristics as well as overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: We showed usability of molecular HPV testing on a cohort of archived penile carcinomas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating LCD-Array technique on a cohort of penile neoplasias.

AB  - Introduction/Background Cervical dysplasia up to cervical carcinoma are in almost 100% associated with a high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection. The immunosuppressive influence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the immunocompromised period of pregnancy are risk factors for acquisition and persistence of HR-HPV infections and their progression to precancerous lesions and HPV-associated carcinoma. There is still a lack of guideline-defined approaches, due to the lack of sufficient research, especially in Europe, for the screening and follow up of pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) to prevent HPV-related cervical dysplasia. Methodology HIV-positive pregnant women were included (n=81). HPV test and genotyping HPV test (multiplexed genotyping with BSGP5+/6+ PCR and Luminex read-out), cytology and colposcopy was done. A medical history questionnaire was used to record the clinical- and HIV data of the participants. Results are given in percentage. For continuous variables, mean or median was calculated. Categorical variables were compared by using chi2 test, whereas for continuous variables Mann-Whitney-U test was used. A p-value <= 0.05 was regarded statistically significant (CI 95%). Results The HR-HPV prevalence in our study population was 45.7%. Multiple HPV infections were present in 27.2% of women, of whom all had at least one HR-HPV genotype included. HR-HPV16 and HR-HPV52 were the most common genotypes and were always present when high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was found (figure 1). Overall, 95.1% of study participants had an adequately treated HIV infection. HIV viral load < 50 copies/mL and a CD4 cell count >= 350 cells/mul correlated with a lower HR-HPV prevalence. In addition, a shorter HIV diagnosis time showed an increased prevalence of HR- and multiple HPV infections. Conclusion HIV-positive pregnant women require particularly attentive and extended HPV screening, where clinical and HIV-related risk factors should always be taken into account. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Objective: To determine the cost effectiveness of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) human papillomavirus (HPV) assay and convectional cytology co-testing for the detection of cervical neoplasia. Method(s): We enrolled two hundred consecutive eligible women evaluated in the Outpatient department at the University Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Skopje aged 30-64 years. The patients were offered a HC2+ conventional cytology in addition to any test ordered by their attending physician free of charge and strictly on voluntary basis. Patient were informed about the study and written consent was obtained at the time of enrollment. Any and all medical decisions regarding patient evaluation/treatment were based on the conventional cytology algorithm, according to hospital protocol. We retrospectively gauged CIN2+, CIN 3+ detection rates and potential decrease in additional procedures and cost when implementing a HC2/cytology co-testing algorithm. Result(s): The average age of the women included was 44 +/- 11 years, ranging from 30 to 64. A total of 200 cytology smears, 200 HC2 tests, 76 (38%) colpos-copy examinations, 45 PCR (22.5%) based HPV tests and 50(25%) cervical biopsies were performed. The HC2/cytology co-testing algorithm yielded a histologi-cally verified CIN2+ detection rate of 19/22 (86.36%), and a CIN3+ lesion detection rate of 14/14 (100%) when compared to the conventional cytology algorithm. The sensitivity, specif icity, LR+ and LR-of the HC2 test in the detection of CIN2+ lesions were 88%, 87.5%, 7.04 and 0.13, respectively, giving the test an accuracy of 87.72%. Using the conventional cytology-based algorithm required 76 referrals for colpos-copy, 45 referrals for PCR based HPV detection and 50 referrals for cervical biopsy, compared to 41 cytology test, 33 colposcopy referrals and 22 biopsy referrals. Conclusion(s): Implementing a HC2 based cervical cancer screening algorithm reduces the number of colposcopy/biopsy referrals by over 50%, compared to a conventional cytology algorithm without a meaningful impact on the CIN2+/CIN3+ detection rates.

AB  - Background: Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is caused by tobacco and alcohol or by HPV infection, which is associated with a better overall survival. A growing incidence of OPC with a decrease in other risk factors suggests a rising proportion of HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas. However, regional differences exist and require further analyses. Therefore we analysed the incidence and the survival of OPCpatients and the test-rate for HPV in the largest European cancer registry in North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW), Germany. Method(s): All patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer (ICD-10: C01; C02.4; C05.1; C05.2; C09.0-9; C10.0-9) during 2008-2018 were included in the study. We assumed a carcinoma to be HPV-associated if either p16-IHC-test and/or HPV-DNA-PCR test was positive. In this retrospective study we analysed pseudonymized individual pathology and incidence reports collected by the cancer registry to extract our data. Five-year survival was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier Estimator. Result(s): A total of 10.652 cases of oropharyngeal cancer were reported in the study period. Age standardized incidence rate was 4.1 (SE 0.041) and constant over time. The majority (M:71.9%;n = 7663/W:28.1%n = 2989) of all cases were men, which is comparable to the distribution for HPVassociated OPC (M:70,3%;n = 786/W:29,7%;n = 332). 1,866 (17.5%) of OPC were tested for HPV. (M:70,4%;1314/W29,6%;552) In 2008 the test rate was 2.3% (n = 20), which increased steadily to 49.3% (n = 490) in 2018. HPV detection rate was 59,9% (n = 1118) in tested cases, which remained stable during the observation period.(M:59,8%; W:60,1%) Five-year survival was better for HPVassociated OPC (0.656; SE 0.023) than for non-HPV-associated OPC (0.430; SE 0.026) and not-HPVtested OPC (0.468; SE 0.006). Five-year survival was slightly worse for men with OPC (0.466; SE 0.007) than for women (0.531; SE 0.011). The mean age was 63.0 (n = 10,652; HPV+O = 62,5; HPVO = 62,7). Conclusion(s): In line with existing data, HPV-associated OPC achieved a better prognosis in NRW. HPV test rate increased in OPC recently, however, about 50% were still not tested. With relatively constant fractions of HPV-positive OPC in the tested group over the timespan our data does not suggest a rise in the fraction of HPV-associated OPC, which is in contrast to published data. The retrospective analyses, variance in HPV testing as well as the lack of occupational or behavioural hazards captured in the registry limit the interpretation of our data.

AB  - The impact of the relation of human papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) on overall survival (OS) was investigated in a retrospective population-based study in Thuringia, Germany. A total of 498 patients with OPSCC (76.9% men; mean age 62.5 years) from 2018 to 2020 were included. OPSCC cases were 37.3% HPV-positive (+) (31.2% smokers; mean incidence: 2.91/100,000 population) and 57.8% HPV-negative (63.5% smokers; mean incidence: 4.50/100,000 population). Median follow-up was 20 months. HPV+ patients had significantly better OS than HPV-negative (-) patients (HPV+: 2-year OS: 90.9%; HPV-: 2-year OS: 73.6%; p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, HPV- patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 4.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-8.6), patients with higher N classification (N2: HR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.71-6.20; N3: HR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.75-7.31) and with a higher cancer staging (III: HR = 5.7; 95% CI: 1.8-17.6; IV: HR = 19.3; 95% CI: 6.3-57.3) had an increased hazard of death. HPV- smokers formed the majority in Thuringia. Nicotine and alcohol habits had no impact on OS. Optimizing OPSCC therapeutic strategies due to the dominance of HPV- is more important than discussing de-escalation strategies for HPV+ patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced penile carcinoma is characterized by poor prognosis. Most data on prognostic factors are based on small study cohorts, and even meta-analyses are limited in patient numbers. Therefore, there is still a lack of evidence for clinical decisions. In addition, the most recent TNM classification is questionable; in line with previous studies, we found that it has not improved prognosis estimation. METHODS: We evaluated 297 patients from Germany, Russia, and Portugal. Tissue samples from 233 patients were re-analyzed by two experienced pathologists. HPV status, p16, and histopathological parameters were evaluated for all patients. RESULTS: Advanced lymph node metastases (N2, N3) were highly significantly associated with reductions in metastasis-free (MFS), cancer-specific (CS), and overall survival (OS) rates (p = <0.001), while lymphovascular invasion was a significant parameter for reduced CS and OS (p = 0.005; p = 0.007). Concerning the primary tumor stage, a significant difference in MFS was found only between pT1b and pT1a (p = 0.017), whereas CS and OS did not significantly differ between T categories. In patients without lymph node metastasis at the time of primary diagnosis, lymphovascular invasion was a significant prognostic parameter for lower MFS (p = 0.032). Histological subtypes differed in prognosis, with the worst outcome in basaloid carcinomas, but without statistical significance. HPV status was not associated with prognosis, either in the total cohort or in the usual type alone. CONCLUSION: Lymphatic involvement has the highest impact on prognosis in penile cancer, whereas HPV status alone is not suitable as a prognostic parameter. The pT1b stage, which includes grading, as well as lymphovascular and perineural invasion in the T stage, seems questionable; a revision of the TNM classification is therefore required.

AB  - Knowledge of human papillomavirus transmission from the genital tract to the oral mucosa remains unsatisfactory, with poor and often inconsistent literature results. The increase in HPV-associated oral malignancies prompts further analysis of the simultaneous detection of the virus in the two anatomical areas and on the identification of genotypes to be included in future vaccines. Therefore, in this retrospective study, we evaluated orogenital HPV concurrence, hrHPV, lrHPV and type-concordance in 337 samples, as well as the prevalence of the most common genotypes not included in HPV vaccines. Concurrence was found in 12.5% (31/248) of cases, hr-concordance in 61.3% (19/31) and lr-concordance in 12.9% (4/31). Finally, type-concordance was found in 32.3% (10/31) of concurrent infections. Regarding the identification of non-vaccine genotypes, the significantly prevalent genotypes in the anogenital area were HPV66 (12.6%, p < 0.0001), HPV53 (11.1%, p < 0.0001), HPV51 (8.7%, p < 0.0001), HPV42 (8.2%, p < 0.0001) and HPV68 (5.6%, p = 0.0034) in women and HPV66 (14.6%, p = 0.0058), HPV42 (12.2%, p = 0.0428), HPV51 (12.2%, p = 0.0428), HPV53 (12.2%, p = 0.0428), HPV70 (12.2%, p = 0.0428) and HPV73 (12.2%, p = 0.0428) in men. Considering the results of our study, we recommend including the high-risk genotypes HPV51, HPV68, HPV53 and HPV66 in future HPV vaccine formulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) driven by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are increasing worldwide, being higher in high-income countries. However, data from Italy are scanty. p16(INK4a) overexpression is the standard in determining HPV-driven carcinogenesis, but disease prevalence impacts on its positive predictive value. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study enrolling 390 consecutive patients aged >/=18 years, diagnosed with pathologically confirmed OPSCC in Northeastern Italy between 2000 and 2022. High-risk HPV-DNA and p16(INK4a) status were retrieved from medical records or evaluated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. A tumor was defined as HPV-driven when double positive for high-risk HPV-DNA and p16(INK4a) overexpression. RESULTS: Overall, 125 cases (32%) were HPV-driven, with a significant upward temporal trend from 12% in 2000-2006 to 50% in 2019-2022. The prevalence of HPV-driven cancer of the tonsil and base of the tongue increased up to 59%, whereas it remained below 10% in other subsites. Consequently, the p16(INK4a) positive predictive value was 89% for the former and 29% for the latter. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPV-driven OPSCC continued to increase, even in the most recent period. When using p16(INK4a) overexpression as a surrogate marker of transforming HPV infection, each institution should consider the subsite-specific prevalence rates of HPV-driven OPSCC as these significantly impact on its positive predictive value.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the expanding role of immune checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, understanding immunological processes in the tumor microevironment (TME) has strong translational importance. Though analytical methods for a comprehensive analysis of the immunological TME have constantly improved and expanded over the past years the prognostic relevance of immune cell composition in head and neck cancer TME largely remains ambiguous with most studies focusing on one or a small subset of immune cells. METHODS: The overall survival (OS) of the TCGA-HNSC patient cohort comprising 513 head and neck cancer patients was correlated with a total of 29 different immune metrics including a wide spectrum of immune cell subpopulations as well as immune checkpoint receptors and cytokines using RNAseq based immune deconvolution analyses. The most significant predictors of survival among these 29 immune metrics were validated on a separate HNSCC patient cohort (n=101) using immunohistochemistry: CD3, CD20+CXCR5, CD4+CXCR5, Foxp3 and CD68. RESULTS: Overall immune infiltration irrespective of immune cell composition showed no significant correlation with the patients' overall survival in the TCGA-HNSC cohort. However, when focusing on different immune cell subpopulations, naive B cells (p=0.0006), follicular T-helper cells (p<0.0001), macrophages (p=0.0042), regulatory T cells (p=0.0306), lymphocytes (p=0.0001), and cytotoxic T cells (p=0.0242) were identified as highly significant predictors of improved patient survival. Using immunohistochemical detection of these immune cells in a second independent validation cohort of 101 HNSCC patients, we confirmed the prognostic relevance of follicular T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells and lymphocytes. In multivariable analysis, HPV negativity and advanced UICC stages were identified as additional prognostic biomarkers associated with poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the prognostic relevance of the immunological tumor environment in head and neck cancer and demonstrates that a more detailed analysis of immune cell composition and immune cell subtypes is necessary to accurately prognosticate. We observed the highest prognostic relevance for lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, and follicular T helper cells, suggesting further investigations focusing on these specific immune cell subpopulations not only as predictors of patient prognosis but also as promising targets of new immunotherapeutic strategies.

AB  - Women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL/CIN) are at high risk of anal human papillomavirus HPV infection, and it has also been suggested that self-inoculation of the virus from the anal canal to the cervix could explain HPV recurrence in the cervix after treatment of HSIL/CIN. We aimed to evaluate the bidirectional interactions of HPV infection between these two anatomical sites. We evaluated 68 immunocompetent women undergoing excisional treatment for HSIL/CIN. Immediately before treatment, samples from the anus and the cervix were obtained (baseline anal and cervical HPV status). Cervical HPV clearance after treatment was defined as treatment success. The first follow-up control was scheduled 4-6 months after treatment for cervical and anal samples. High resolution anoscopy (HRA) was performed on patients with persistent anal HPV infections or abnormal anal cytology in the first control. Baseline anal HPV was positive in 42/68 (61.8%) of the women. Anal HPV infection persisted after treatment in 29/68 (42.6%) of the women. One-third of these women (10/29; 34.5%) had HSIL/anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). Among women achieving treatment success, cervical HPV in the first control was positive in 34.6% and 17.6% of the patients with positive and negative baseline anal HPV infection, respectively (p = 0.306). In conclusion, patients with persisting anal HPV after HSIL/CIN treatment are at high risk of HSIL/AIN, suggesting that these women would benefit from anal exploration. The study also suggests that women with anal HPV infection treated for HSIL/CIN might be at higher risk of recurrent cervical HPV even after successful treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is associated in nearly 100% with persistent high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. ICC is still one of the leading causes for cancer mortality in women worldwide. The immunosuppressive influence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the immunocompromised period of pregnancy due to tolerance induction against the hemiallogeneic fetus, are generally risk factors for acquisition and persistence of HR-HPV infections and their progression to precancerous lesions and HPV-associated carcinoma. METHODS: Overall, 81 pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) were included. A medical history questionnaire was used to record clinical and HIV data. Participants received cervicovaginal cytological smear, colposcopy and HPV testing. HPV test was performed using BSGP5+/6+ PCR with Luminex read-out. The HR-HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 were additionally grouped together as high-high-risk HPV (HHR-HPV) for the purpose of risk-adapted analysis. RESULTS: HR-HPV prevalence was 45.7%. Multiple HPV infections were detected in 27.2% of participants, of whom all had at least one HR-HPV genotype included. HR-HPV16 and HR-HPV52 were the most prevalent genotypes and found when high squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was detected by cytology. HIV viral load of >/= 50 copies/ml was associated with higher prevalence of HR-HPV infections. Whereas, CD4 T cells < 350/microl showed association with occurrence of multiple HPV infections. Time since HIV diagnosis seemed to impact HPV prevalence. CONCLUSION: Pregnant WLWH require particularly attentive and extended HPV-, colposcopical- and cytological screening, whereby clinical and HIV-related risk factors should be taken into account.

AB  - PURPOSE: According to the recently implemented organized cervical cancer screening program in Germany, women older than 35 years with negative cytology but persistent high-risk human papilloma virus (hrHPV) infection > 12 months should be referred to colposcopy for further evaluation. This study aimed to present and dissect colposcopic and histopathological findings with particular focus on associated hrHPV genotypes. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 89 hrHPV positive patients with normal cytology who underwent colposcopic examination at a certified dysplasia outpatient clinic in Germany in 2021. RESULTS: While 38 (43%) women had a normal colposcopic finding, 45 (51%) had minor and 6 (7%) major changes. Thirty-one (35%) of the women were HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 positive and 58 (65%) women were positive for other hrHPV only. Among patients who underwent colposcopy with biopsies (in case of an abnormal finding or type 3 transformation zone, n = 68), eight (12%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 and six (9%) had CIN 2. The proportion of women diagnosed with CIN 3 varied among different hrHPV genotypes (HPV 16: 11%, HPV 18: 33%, HPV 31: 27%, HPV 33: 33%, HPV 52: 33%). CONCLUSION: Persistently hrHPV positive women with negative cytology are at increased risk of being diagnosed with CIN 3. As CIN 3 prevalence seems to differ with regard to hrHPV strain, immediate HPV genotyping for risk stratification and subsequent early referral for colposcopy might constitute a feasible strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: p16(INK4a) (p16) immunohistochemistry is the most widely used biomarker assay for inferring HPV causation in oropharyngeal cancer in clinical and trial settings. However, discordance exists between p16 and HPV DNA or RNA status in some patients with oropharyngeal cancer. We aimed to clearly quantify the extent of discordance, and its prognostic implications. METHODS: In this multicentre, multinational individual patient data analysis, we did a literature search in PubMed and Cochrane database for systematic reviews and original studies published in English between Jan 1, 1970, and Sept 30, 2022. We included retrospective series and prospective cohorts of consecutively recruited patients previously analysed in individual studies with minimum cohort size of 100 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. Patient inclusion criteria were diagnosis with a primary squamous cell carcinoma of oropharyngeal cancer; data on p16 immunohistochemistry and on HPV testing; information on age, sex, tobacco, and alcohol use; staging by TNM 7th edition; information on treatments received; and data on clinical outcomes and follow-up (date of last follow-up if alive, date of recurrence or metastasis, and date and cause of death). There were no limits on age or performance status. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients of the overall cohort who showed the different p16 and HPV result combinations, as well as 5-year overall survival and 5-year disease-free survival. Patients with recurrent or metastatic disease or who were treated palliatively were excluded from overall survival and disease-free survival analyses. Multivariable analysis models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for different p16 and HPV testing methods for overall survival, adjusted for prespecified confounding factors. FINDINGS: Our search returned 13 eligible studies that provided individual data for 13 cohorts of patients with oropharyngeal cancer from the UK, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain. 7895 patients with oropharyngeal cancer were assessed for eligibility. 241 were excluded before analysis, and 7654 were eligible for p16 and HPV analysis. 5714 (74.7%) of 7654 patients were male and 1940 (25.3%) were female. Ethnicity data were not reported. 3805 patients were p16-positive, 415 (10.9%) of whom were HPV-negative. This proportion differed significantly by geographical region and was highest in the areas with lowest HPV-attributable fractions (r=-0.744, p=0.0035). The proportion of patients with p16+/HPV- oropharyngeal cancer was highest in subsites outside the tonsil and base of tongue (29.7% vs 9.0%, p<0.0001). 5-year overall survival was 81.1% (95% CI 79.5-82.7) for p16+/HPV+, 40.4% (38.6-42.4) for p16-/HPV-, 53.2% (46.6-60.8) for p16-/HPV+, and 54.7% (49.2-60.9) for p16+/HPV-. 5-year disease-free survival was 84.3% (95% CI 82.9-85.7) for p16+/HPV+, 60.8% (58.8-62.9) for p16-/HPV-; 71.1% (64.7-78.2) for p16-/HPV+, and 67.9% (62.5-73.7) for p16+/HPV-. Results were similar across all European sub-regions, but there were insufficient numbers of discordant patients from North America to draw conclusions in this cohort. INTERPRETATION: Patients with discordant oropharyngeal cancer (p16-/HPV+ or p16+/HPV-) had a significantly worse prognosis than patients with p16+/HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer, and a significantly better prognosis than patients with p16-/HPV- oropharyngeal cancer. Along with routine p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV testing should be mandated for clinical trials for all patients (or at least following a positive p16 test), and is recommended where HPV status might influence patient care, especially in areas with low HPV-attributable fractions.

AB  - Regarding attempts to find de-escalation methods of treatment for patients with HPV16-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC), there is an urgent need to identify new prognostic factors which allow physicians to differentiate the prognosis of these patients. The aim of the study is to compare the incidence of transcriptionally active HPV16 infection and its type as well as other epidemiological, clinical, and histopathological features between SCC of the base of the tongue (BOTSCC) and tonsils (TSSCC). The analysis was performed in a group of 63 patients with OPSCC, for which, in our earlier studies, we assessed transcriptionally active HPV16 infection and its type (viral load and viral genome status). Transcriptionally active HPV16 infection was significantly more common in TSSCC (96.3%) than in BOTSCC (3.7%). Patients with TSSCC had significantly higher disease-free survival rates (84.1%) than those with BTSCC (47.4%); the same was true in the subgroup with HPV16 positivity. The obtained results are an important indication for further research on the development of new prognostic and/or predictive factors for patients with HPV16-positive squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx.

AB  - Extra-cellular galectins 1, 3 and 9 (gal-1, -3 and -9) are known to act as soluble immunosuppressive agents in various malignancies. Previous publications have suggested that their expression is dependent on the metabolic status of producing cells and reciprocally that they can influence metabolic pathways in their target cells. Very little is known about the status of gal-1, -3 and -9 in patients bearing head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and about their relationships with the systemic metabolic condition. This study was conducted in plasma samples from a prospective cohort of 83 HNSCC patients with advanced disease. These samples were used to explore the distribution of gal-1, -3 and -9 and simultaneously to profile a series of 87 metabolites assessed by mass spectrometry. We identified galectin and metabolic patterns within five disease categories defined according to the primary site and human papillomavirus (HPV) status (HPV-positive and -negative oropharyngeal carcinomas, carcinomas of the oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx carcinomas). Remarkably, samples related to hypopharyngeal carcinomas displayed the highest average concentration of gal-9 (p = .017) and a trend toward higher concentrations of kynurenine, a potential factor of tumor growth and immune suppression. In contrast, there was a tendency toward higher concentrations of fatty acids in samples related to oral cavity. These observations emphasize the diversity of HPV-negative HNSCCs. Depending on their primary site, they evolve into distinct types of immune and metabolic landscapes that seem to be congruent with specific oncogenic mechanisms.

AB  - Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is considered a precursor of adenocarcinoma. Cervical adenocarcinoma has been associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), while other subtypes of AIS and endocervical adenocarcinoma have no precursor lesions and are not associated with HPV. Cervical cytology and HPV genotyping are important in the detection of these different subtypes. Notably, endometrial lesions and infiltration with secondary adenocarcinoma may lead to misdiagnosis of endocervical lesions. The aim of the present study was to avoid misdiagnosis of squamous cell changes and endometrial lesions as endocervical lesions in cervical screening. A total of 210,510 female cytological samples were analyzed between the beginning of January 2020 and the beginning of January 2021. The samples were processed for conventional cytological techniques, and for molecular detection and subtyping of high-risk HPV (HPV-HR) according to the advice and measurements of BD Biosciences (117,765 samples) and the PapilloCheck((R)) HPV test (5,579 samples). The present study was carried out in Germany using the Munich classification III. II-g (Bethesda classification: atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified) was detected in 0.12% of cases under the age of 35 years. Another peak was noticed within the 41-60-years age group (0.11%). In the 41-50-years age group, a peak for II-e (Bethesda classification: Endometrial cells) (1.5%) was identified. An association was revealed between HPV16, HPV18 and HPV45 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III, AIS, endocervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, in addition to other HPV-HR subtypes, such as HPV33/58, as well as 52, 56/59/66 in the different age groups. In patients aged <35 years, 0.03% of cases were vaccinated cases against HPV. In the 35-40-years age group, there was only one vaccinated case (0.0045%); in the 41-50-years age group, there were 11 vaccinated cases (0.031%); and in the 51-60-years age group, there was one vaccinated case (0.002%). No patients aged >60 years were vaccinated against HPV in the analyzed cohort. In conclusion, most cases of HPV-associated glandular dysplastic changes and neoplasia occurred in sexually active women aged between 35 and 60 years. In addition, endocervical adenocarcinoma may occur at any age with or without an HPV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Each high-risk HPV genotype has different oncogenic potential, and the risk of CIN3+ varies according to genotype. We evaluated the performance of different strategies of HPV-positivity triage combining cytology, p16/ki67 dual staining (DS), and extended genotyping. METHODS: Samples from 3180 consecutive women from the NTCC2 study (NCT01837693) positive for HPV DNA at primary screening, were retrospectively analyzed by the BD Onclarity HPV Assay, which allows extended genotyping. Genotypes were divided into three groups based on the risk of CIN3+. HPV DNA-positive women were followed up for 24 months or to clearance. FINDINGS: Combining the three groups of genotypes with cytology or DS results we identify a group of women who need immediate colposcopy (PPV for CIN3+ from 7.8 to 20.1%), a group that can be referred to 1-year HPV retesting (PPV in those HPV-positive at retesting from 2.2 to 3.8), and a group with a very low 24-month CIN3+ risk, i.e. 0.4%, composed by women cytology or DS negative and positive for HPV 56/59/66 or 35/39/68 or negative with the Onclarity test, who can be referred to 3-year retesting. INTERPRETATION: Among the baseline HPV DNA positive/cytology or DS negative women, the extended genotyping allows to stratify for risk of CIN3+, and to identify a group of women with a risk of CIN3+ so low in the next 24 months that they could be referred to a new screening round after 3 years.

AB  - Methylation markers have shown potential for triaging high-risk HPV-positive (hrHPV+) women to identify those at increased risk of invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Our aim was to assess the performance of the S5 DNA methylation classifier for predicting incident high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and ICC among hrHPV+ women in the ARTISTIC screening trial cohort. The S5 classifier, comprising target regions of tumour suppressor gene EPB41L3 and L1 and L2 regions of HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, and HPV33, was assayed by pyrosequencing in archived hrHPV+ liquid-based samples from 343 women with high-grade disease (139 CIN2, 186 CIN3, and 18 ICC) compared to 800 hrHPV+ controls. S5 DNA methylation correlated directly with increasing severity of disease and inversely with lead time to diagnosis. S5 could discriminate between hrHPV+ women who developed CIN3 or ICC and hrHPV+ controls (p <.0001) using samples taken on average 5 years before diagnosis. This relationship was independent of cytology at baseline. The S5 test showed much higher sensitivity than HPV16/18 genotyping for identifying prevalent CIN3 (93% vs. 61%, p = .01) but lower specificity (50% vs. 66%, p <.0001). The S5 classifier identified most women at high risk of developing precancer and missed very few prevalent advanced lesions thus appearing to be an objective test for triage of hrHPV+ women. The combination of methylation of host and HPV genes enables S5 to combine the predictive power of methylation with HPV genotyping to identify hrHPV-positive women who are at highest risk of developing CIN3 and ICC in the future.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of AIS and AC in the histological cone of women treated for CIN3. Furthermore, through the study of the specific HR HPV genotypes, we obtained more information on the possible different nature between the single CIN3 lesion and the CIN3 coexisting with the glandular lesion. METHODS: A sample of 414 women underwent LEEP for CIN3. The study sample consisted of 370 women with a CIN3 lesion alone and 44 women with a CIN3 lesion coexisting with AIS or adenocarcinoma. We studied the individual HR HPV genotypes and their frequency in the two groups under study. Furthermore, the therapeutic results and follow-ups for the population were studied on the entire study sample. RESULTS: In patients with a single CIN3 lesion, 11 high-risk genotypes were detected; in patients with CIN3 associated with AIS or AC, only 4 different genotypes were detected (16, 18, 45, 33). Overall, the frequency of HPV 18 was significantly higher in CIN3 coexisting with AIS compared to solitary CIN3 lesions, chi2 = 27.73 (p < 0.001), while the frequency of other high-risk genotypes was significantly higher in patients with a single CIN3 than in patients with CIN3 coexisting with AIS. In our study population, mixed lesions (CIN3 coexisting with AIS), unlike their squamous counterparts (single CIN3 lesions), were characterized by skip lesions, which demonstrate more aggressive behavior and a higher rate of viral persistence and recurrence. CONCLUSION: A relatively high rate (10.7%) of AIS-AC was found in women treated for CIN3. Our study confirms the multifocal biological nature of the CIN3 lesion coexisting with AIS compared to the single CIN3 lesion. All this justifies the different treatments to which CIN3 lesions coexisting with AIS are addressed; in fact, the latter are treated with hysterectomy, while CIN3 is treated with conization alone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal cancer is a global health concern due to its multifaceted nature. Recent molecular studies have linked p16 overexpression, associated with the human papillomavirus, to oropharyngeal cancer and its prognostic implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study in Western Romania examined 60 patients, categorizing them based on p16 biomarker status: 28 were p16 positive, and 32 were p16 negative. Statistical tests, including Fisher's exact and chi2, were used for analysis. RESULTS: Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer exhibited a better prognosis (3-year survival, p = 0.0477; midtreatment, p = 0.0349) and reported lower alcohol (p = 0.0046) and tobacco (p < 0.0001) use. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the importance of p16 testing in oropharyngeal carcinoma diagnosis. It suggests modifying treatment approaches based on p16 status and underscores the differing prognoses associated with p16-positive and p16-negative cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in disruptions to healthcare systems throughout the world. The numbers of cytology examinations, human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, and women referred for colposcopy decreased in many countries. There have been no reports on cervical cancer screening in Germany. This study aimed to describe changes in the numbers of colposcopies, cytology examinations, HPV tests, and histological results during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic years in order to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cervical cancer screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The numbers of colposcopies, cytology examinations, HPV tests, and histologic results were analyzed retrospectively for the period January 2018 to December 2022. The 2 years period before the pandemic (2018 and 2019) were compared with the 3 years period of the pandemic (2020-2022). RESULTS: In total, 6,518 colposcopies were performed in 5,579 women. The numbers of colposcopies, cytology examinations, and high-risk HPV (hrHPV) tests increased during the pandemic years. The number of biopsies per year taken was stable (range=450-554). The relative numbers of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III/HSIL findings were stable, while the numbers of cervical cancers identified increased slightly from 15 (6.6%) in 2018 to 22 (7.4%) in 2022. CONCLUSION: Increases in numbers of women examined and colposcopies were observed in the years 2021 and 2022 during the pandemic, in comparison to the preceding years. These also led to increases in the figures for cytology, hrHPV, histology, and operations. The onset of the pandemic occurred in the same year as a newly organized screening program started in Germany. The increases might therefore be due to the newly organized screening system.

AB  - The prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is poorly understood. It is unclear how the presence of neutrophils affects prognosis due to their polarization into cytotoxic N1 or immunosuppressive N2. Therefore, we determined the number of CD66b+ neutrophil granulocytes separately in the stromal and epithelial compartments in cancer tissues from 397 patients with HNSCC. Tumor samples from six historical patient groups were processed into tissue microarrays and stained immunohistochemically. In total, 21.9% were HPV positive (p16+). Neutrophil counts were much lower in the stromal compartment (372 +/- 812) than in the epithelial cancer compartment (1040 +/- 1477) (p < 0.001), with large differences between groups. In three groups with high neutrophil infiltration, high rates were associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas in two groups, high rates were a negative prognostic factor. In p16- oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer high infiltration was associated with a favorable prognosis. Cancers with an exclusion of neutrophils in the epithelial compartment were associated with improved prognosis. In oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal HPV-negative cancer high neutrophil infiltration rates were clearly associated with prolonged survival. Neutrophil granulocytes in HNSCC may contribute to a favorable or unfavorable prognosis.

AB  - Background: The aim was to evaluate the interaction of human papillomavirus (HPV), smoking and alcohol status on oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) on overall survival (OS) in population-based setting. Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study, data of 498 patients with OPSCC (mean age: 62.5 years; 77% male) from 2018 and 2020 were included. Binary logistic regression analysis and Cox multivariable regression analysis were performed. Result(s): OPSCC were 37.3% HPV-positive (+; among them 31.2% smokers; mean incidence: 2.91/100,000 population) and 57.8% HPV-negative (-; 63.5% smokers; mean incidence: 4.50/100,000 population). Median follow-up was 20 months. HPV+ patients had significantly better OS than HPV- patients (HPV+: 2-year OS: 90.9%; HPV-: 2-year OS: 73.6%; p < 0.001). In binary logistic regression analysis, smokers showed a 4.5 increased odds ratio (OR) of being tested HPV- than for nonsmokers (OR: 4.5; 95% CI: 2.76-7.35; p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, HPV- patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 4.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4 - 8.6), patients with a higher N classification (N2: HR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.71 - 6.20; N3: HR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.75 -7.31) and with a higher cancer staging (III: HR = 5.7; 95% CI: 1.8 - 17.6; IV: HR = 19.3; 95% CI: 6.3 -57.3) had an increased hazard of death (all p < 0.05). Smoking and alcohol habits had no significant independent effect on OS (smokers: HR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.65 - 1.83; IV: alcoholics: HR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.87 - 2.3; both p > 0.05) Discussion: Worldwide studies have reported an increase of HPV+ OPSCC. The result is that HPV+ has overtaken HPV- OPSCC in many countries. In contrast, HPV+ OPSCC still is a minority in Thuringia, especially HPV+ OPSCC in non-smokers. Classical risk factors continue to dominate and have greatest impact on OS. Conclusion(s): It is more important to optimize therapeutic strategies for HPV- OPSCC than to discuss de-escalation strategies for HPV+ patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPV-related cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most frequent cancer in women worldwide. Cell-free tumour DNA is a potent biomarker to detect treatment response, residual disease, and relapse. We investigated the potential use of cell-free circulating HPV-DNA (cfHPV-DNA) in plasma of patients with CC. METHODS: cfHPV-DNA levels were measured using a highly sensitive next-generation sequencing-based approach targeting a panel of 13 high-risk HPV types. RESULTS: Sequencing was performed in 69 blood samples collected from 35 patients, of which 26 were treatment-naive when the first liquid biopsy sample was retrieved. cfHPV-DNA was successfully detected in 22/26 (85%) cases. A significant correlation between tumour burden and cfHPV-DNA levels was observed: cfHPV-DNA was detectable in all treatment-naive patients with advanced-stage disease (17/17, FIGO IB3-IVB) and in 5/9 patients with early-stage disease (FIGO IA-IB2). Sequential samples revealed a decrease of cfHPV-DNA levels in 7 patients corresponding treatment response and an increase in a patient with relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study we demonstrated the potential of cfHPV-DNA as a biomarker for therapy monitoring in patients with primary and recurrent CC. Our findings facilitate the development of a sensitive and precise, non-invasive, inexpensive, and easily accessible tool in CC diagnosis, therapy monitoring and follow-up.

AB  - Analytical and clinical performance validation is essential before introduction of a new human papillomavirus (HPV) assay into clinical practice. This study compares the new BD Onclarity HPV assay, which detects E6/E7 DNA from 14 high-risk HPV types, to the Hybrid Capture II (HC2) HPV DNA test, to concurrent cytology and histology results, in order to evaluate its performance in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. A population of 567 women, including 325 with >/=ASCUS (where ASCUS stands for atypical cells of undetermined significance) and any HC2 result and 242 with both negative cytology and negative HC2 results, were prospectively enrolled for the study. The overall agreement between Onclarity and HC2 was 94.6% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 92.3% to 96.2%). In this population with a high prevalence of disease, the relative sensitivities (versus adjudicated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 [CIN2+] histology endpoints) of the Onclarity and HC2 tests were 95.2% (95% CI, 90.7% to 97.5%) and 96.9% (95% CI, 92.9% to 98.7%), respectively, and the relative specificities were 50.3% (95% CI, 43.2% to 57.4%) for BD and 40.8% (95% CI, 33.9%, 48.1%) for HC2. These results indicate that the BD Onclarity HPV assay has sensitivity comparable to that of the HC2 assay, with a trend to an increased specificity. Moreover, as Onclarity gives the chance to discriminate between the different genotypes, we calculated the genotype prevalence and the absolute risk of CIN2+: HPV 16 was the most prevalent genotype (19.8%) with an absolute risk of CIN2+ of 77.1%.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) determination and the cotesting HPV and anal cytology value to detect high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) in a cohort of HIV-MSM. DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective study of HIV-infected MSM who underwent screening for anal dysplasia. Screening program includes anal cytology, HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) at each visit. Histological samples were obtained if suspicious lesions were revealed by HRA. Sensitivity and specificity of the different tests were calculated by using histological results of HRA-guided biopsy as the reference test for HGAIN diagnosis. RESULTS: From May 2009 to August 2016, 692 HIV-infected MSM underwent 1827 anal cytologies, 1841 HRA examinations, and 1607 HPV testing. At first screening visit, anal cytology results were abnormal in 418 (60.4%) of 692 patients, and oncogenic HPV genotypes were found in 482 (79.5%) of 606 patients. Anal cytology showed a sensitivity of 89.2% [95% confidence interval (CI); 80.7-94.2] and a specificity of 44.2% (95% CI; 40.2-48.2) to detect HGAIN. Oncogenic HPV testing had 90.4% sensitivity (95% CI; 82-86.8) and 24.4% specificity (95% CI; 20.8-28.3). Cotesting showed a 97.4% sensitivity (95% CI; 91-99.3) and 14% specificity (95% CI; 11.2-17.3). In patients with atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance on cytology, oncogenic HPV testing had 91.3% sensitivity and 28.3% specificity to detect HGAIN. CONCLUSION: Abnormal cytology and oncogenic HPV determination showed similar sensitivity for detecting HGAIN. The two tests used together improved the sensitivity but with lowered specificity. In our opinion, HPV testing does not improve HGAIN detection and should not replace anal cytology as a standard screening test for HIV-infected MSM.

AB  - The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on chromosome 6 has been reported to be associated with cervical cancer. We investigated two independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a large case-control series of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma that has been newly established by the German Cervigen Consortium, comprising a total of 2481 cases and 1556 healthy females. We find significant associations for both variants, rs9272117 at HLA-DQA1 and rs2844511 at MICA and HCP5, with cervical disease. Both variants showed evidence of association with invasive cervical cancer (rs9272117: OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.99, P = .036; rs2844511: OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31, P = .008) and with high-grade dysplasia (rs9272117: OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.87, P = 7.1 x 10(-6) ; rs2844511: OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26, P = .035), as well as in a combined analysis of both groups (rs9272117: OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91, P = 6.9 x 10(-5) ; rs2844511: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.26, P = .005). Variant rs2844511, but not rs9272117, also showed modest evidence of association with low-grade dysplasia (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.54, P = .019). In case-only analyses, rs2844511 tended to predict HPV status (P = .044) and rs9272117 tended to associate with HPV16 (P = .022). RNA studies in cervical samples showed a significant correlation in the transcript levels of MICA, HCP5 and HLA-DQA1, suggesting extensive co-regulation. All three genes were upregulated in HPV16-positive samples. In stratified analyses, rs9272117 was associated with HLA-DQA1 levels, specifically in HPV-positive samples, while rs2844511 was associated with MICA and HCP5 levels. The risk allele of rs2844511 was required for correlations between MICA or HCP5 with HLA-DQA1. Altogether, our results support 6p21.32-33 as the first consistent cervical cancer susceptibility locus and provide evidence for a link between genetic risk variants, HPV16 status and transcript levels of HLA-DQA1, HCP5 and MICA, which may contribute to tumor immune evasion.

AB  - Infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with the development of cervical and anal cancer. Worldwide, the incidence of anal cancer has increased markedly. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection of the uterine cervix and anal canal in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- and non-HIV-infected risk populations. Cervical and anal HPV swabs and cytology samples were collected from 287 patients at the University Hospital of Munich, Germany between 2011 and 2013. Patients were divided into HIV-negative controls (G1) and two risk groups, including HIV-negative patients with cytological abnormalities of the cervix (G2) and HIV-infected patients (G3). Data, including clinical parameters, were analysed. The risk groups had significantly more positive results for HPV in the anus (71.03 and 83.15% for G2 and G3, respectively), as compared with G1. The predominant HPV genotypes found in the anus were high-risk HPV genotypes, which were significantly correlated with concomittant cervical HPV findings. In the risk groups, a significant association between the cytological findings and HPV detection in the cervix was found, while the results of the anus revealed no significance. The results of the present study suggested that the prevalence of HPV infection in the anal canal of risk populations is high. Furthermore, patients with abnormal cervical cytology results and HIV-infected women, irrespective of their individual cervical findings, may have a risk of concomittant anal high-risk HPV infection. Based on the predominant HPV genotypes found in the study, HPV vaccination could reduce the incidence of anal cancer. Nevertheless, high-risk patients should be intensively screened for anal squamous intraepithelial abnormalities to avoid invasive cancer stages.

AB  - Testing for E6/E7 mRNA in cells infected with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) might improve the specificity of HPV testing for the identification of cervical precancerous lesions. Here we compared the RNA-based Aptima HPV (AHPV) assay (Hologic) and the DNA-based Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV test (Qiagen) to liquid-based cytology (LBC) for women undergoing routine cervical screening. A total of 10,040 women, 30 to 60 years of age, were invited to participate in the study, 9,451 of whom were included in the analysis. Specimens were tested centrally by LBC, the AHPV test, and the HC2 test, and women who tested positive on any test were referred for colposcopy. Genotyping was performed on all HR-HPV-positive samples. Test characteristics were calculated based on histological review. As a result, we identified 90 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+), including 43 women with CIN3+. Sensitivity differences between the AHPV test and the HC2 test in detecting CIN2+ (P = 0.180) or CIN3+ (P = 0.0625) lesions were statistically nonsignificant. Of three CIN3 cases that were missed with the AHPV test, two cases presented lesion-free cones and one had a non-HR HPV67 infection. The specificity (<CIN2) and positive predictive value (CIN2+) of the AHPV test were significantly higher (both P < 0.001) than those of the HC2 test. The overall agreement between the tests was substantial (kappa = 0.77). Finally, we present results for several possible triage strategies, based on the primary screening test being either the AHPV test or the HC2 test. In summary, the AHPV assay is both specific and sensitive for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions and may be used in primary cervical cancer screening for women >/=30 years of age.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate p16/Ki-67 dual-staining performance for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in the management of women with minor cervical abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 759 enrolled patients were tested for cytology, high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and dual p16/Ki-67 staining. RESULTS: Positivity rates for HR-HPV and dual staining increased as dysplasia was worsened from non-CIN (37.6% and 0%) to CIN1 (62.5% and 1.6%) and CIN2+ (98.7% and 97.3%), respectively. HPV18 and HPV16 exhibited the highest odds ratios (53.16 and 11.31) in the CIN2+ group. Both p16/Ki-67 dual staining and HR-HPV presented similar sensitivities (97.3% and 98.7%, respectively) for CIN2+ detection. Dual staining specificity, however, was 99.3%, significantly higher compared to HR-HPV testing (52.2%). The utility of dual staining was evaluated in different screening strategies and appeared to reduce the number of colposcopies required for the detection of CIN2+ cases. CONCLUSION: p16/Ki-67 dual-staining cytology is a surrogate triage biomarker in cytology-based screening programs, with high performance for efficient risk stratification of women with mild cervical abnormalities.

AB  - To determine the sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 serology as diagnostic marker for HPV16-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), 214 HNSCC patients from Germany and Italy with fresh-frozen tumor tissues and sera collected before treatment were included in this study. Hundred and twenty cancer cases were from the oropharynx and 94 were from head and neck cancer regions outside the oropharynx (45 oral cavity, 12 hypopharynx and 35 larynx). Serum antibodies to early (E1, E2, E6 and E7) and late (L1) HPV16 proteins were analyzed by multiplex serology and were compared to tumor HPV RNA status as the gold standard. A tumor was defined as HPV-driven in the presence of HPV16 DNA and HPV16 transformation-specific RNA transcript patterns (E6*I, E1(wedge) E4 and E1C). Of 120 OPSCC, 66 (55%) were HPV16-driven. HPV16 E6 seropositivity was the best predictor of HPV16-driven OPSCC (diagnostic accuracy 97% [95%CI 92-99%], Cohen's kappa 0.93 [95%CI 0.8-1.0]). Of the 66 HPV-driven OPSCC, 63 were HPV16 E6 seropositive, compared to only one (1.8%) among the 54 non-HPV-driven OPSCC, resulting in a sensitivity of 96% (95%CI 88-98) and a specificity of 98% (95%CI 90-100). Of 94 HNSCC outside the oropharynx, six (6%) were HPV16-driven. In these patients, HPV16 E6 seropositivity had lower sensitivity (50%, 95%CI 19-81), but was highly specific (100%, 95%CI 96-100). In conclusion, HPV16 E6 seropositivity appears to be a highly reliable diagnostic marker for HPV16-driven OPSCC with very high sensitivity and specificity, but might be less sensitive for HPV16-driven HNSCC outside the oropharynx.

AB  - Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is more frequent in men than women mainly due to the heavier and longer duration of smoking in men. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has a role in the rising incidence of OPC in the United States and other high-income countries. To determine whether there is a difference in the proportion of HPV-attributable OPC between men and women, we systematically retrieved HPV prevalence data from 63 studies reporting separately on OPC by gender. The male/female (M/F) ratios of HPV prevalence in OPC across different countries and the corresponding M/F ratios of cumulative lung cancer risk (a proxy for smoking) were compared. The United States had the highest M/F ratios of HPV prevalence in OPC (1.5). The lowest M/F ratios (</=0.7) were found in Asia and some European countries (e.g., France). The countries in which the M/F ratio of HPV prevalence in OPC was >/=1.0 had the most similar lung cancer risks for men and women. When HPV prevalence data were applied to age-standardized OPC incidence rates in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, the M/F ratio for the HPV-positive OPC incidence rates was rather stable (around 4) in all countries. In contrast, the M/F ratio for the HPV-negative OPC incidence rates reached 10.2 in France versus <3 elsewhere. We showed that HPV prevalence in OPC differs by gender and country mainly as a consequence of the vast international variation in male smoking habits. Nevertheless, HPV-positive OPC may affect men more heavily than women in different populations for reasons that are unclear.

AB  - Anal cancer has increasing incidence and is preceded by high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN; AIN2-3). Previously, we identified and validated several methylation markers for accurate detection of anal cancer and HGAIN with cancer risk in HIV-positive (HIV+) men who have sex with men (MSM). This study aimed to evaluate these markers in HIV-negative risk groups. A cross-sectional series of 176 tissue samples of anal cancer, AIN3, AIN2, AIN1 and control biopsies obtained in HIV-negative women and men was tested for six methylation markers (ASCL1, LHX8, SST, WDR17, ZIC1 and ZNF582). Accuracy for detection of AIN3 and cancer (AIN3+) was determined by univariable and multivariable mixed-effect ordinal logistic regression. Methylation levels of all markers increased with increasing severity of disease (P < 0.0001) and were comparable to results in HIV+ MSM. All markers showed high accuracy for AIN3+ detection [area under the curve (AUC): 0.83-0.86]. The optimal marker panel (ASCL1 and ZIC1; AUC = 0.85 for AIN3+) detected 98% of cancers at 79% specificity. In conclusion, DNA methylation markers show a high diagnostic performance for AIN3+ detection in HIV+ and HIV-negative risk groups, justifying broad application of methylation analysis for anal cancer prevention programmes.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of E6/E7 HPV-mRNA overexpression towards HPV-DNA testing and p16/Ki67 immunocytochemistry in a post-op population to verify if this biomarker can be effectively used as indicator of successful cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) treatment. METHODS: Our study retrospectively analyzed 197 patients of our Colposcopy Clinic between January 2013 and September 2020 coming with an abnormal Pap smear suggestive for colposcopy, and after a series of follow-ups including liquid-based cytology (LBC) and punch-biopsy sampling, there were surgically treated. LBC was used for cytology and molecular analysis of the three HPV-related biomarkers. RESULTS: Six months after treatment, 93% of the HPV-mRNA-positive women became negative while this applied to only 80.2% of the HPV-DNA-positive women. HPV persistence was 6.9% at 6-12 months after treatment. The comparison among cytology, colposcopy, HPV-DNA test, and HPV-mRNA test after treatment revealed that the last one is the only with a strong correlation with actual severity (histology during treatment) (rho = 0.345, p = 0.006) implying that clinical cases with more severe CIN may have higher chances of unsuccessful treatment. HPV-mRNA test had higher sensitivity (100%), specificity (96.88%), and positive predictive value (45.45%) for CIN2+ recurrent lesions when compared with HPV-DNA testing (80%, 82.81%, 10.81% respectively) and p16/Ki67 immunocytochemistry (80%, 95.83%, 33.33% respectively) while their negative predictive values were similar. CONCLUSIONS: E6/E7 mRNA detection has higher diagnostic values for the prediction of treatment failure compared with HPV-DNA testing and p16/Ki67 immunocytochemistry, and as an outcome could be used as predictive indicator of CIN-treatment status.

AB  - AIM: In the post-vaccination era, the starting age and time intervals of cervical screening could change (older age and longer screening intervals). This scenario may be achieved by significantly reducing human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 prevalence (genotypes included in the current vaccines). In this regard, assessing the trend over time of these HPV infections in high-grade cervical lesions can provide information on the objective. The present study aimed to evaluate the trend of HPV 16/18 over the years 2007-2018 in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3. METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-institutional study including HPV genotyped and unvaccinated women under 30 with CIN3. The sample was divided into the following periods: 2007-2010, 2011-2014, 2015-2018. HPV genotypes were grouped in genotypes 16/18, genotypes 31/33/35/52/58/67 (genetically related to HPV16), genotypes 39/45/59/68/70 (genetically related to HPV18), genotypes 31/33/45/52/58 (high-risk types included in the nonavalent vaccine), possibly carcinogenic HPV (genotypes 26/30/53/67/70/73/82/85), low-risk HPV (genotypes 6/11/40/42/43/44/54/55/61). The trend between periods and HPV genotypes was measured using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. RESULTS: The final analysis included 474 participants. HPV 16/18 prevalence decreased significantly over the years (77.8% vs 68.9% vs 66.0%, respectively, Ptrend=0.027). Possibly carcinogenic HPV (genotypes 26/30/53/67/70/73/82/85) showed a significant negative prevalence trend over time (4.9% vs 1.1% vs 1.3%, respectively, Ptrend=0.046). Finally, there was a significant positive trend over the years for high-risk HPV genotypes 31/33/45/52/58 in women under 25 (9.9% vs 17.0% vs 24.0%, respectively, Ptrend=0.048). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CIN3 lesions related to HPV 16/18 genotypes decreased over time from 2007 to 2018. These data highlight a herd effect of the HPV vaccine. However, fifteen years after HPV vaccine introduction, we are still a long way from herd immunity. The increase in high-risk types 31/33/45/52/58 will need to be reassessed when the nonavalent vaccine impact will be more reliable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) and tobacco smoking are important risk factors for development of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of tobacco smoking on survival for cases with OPSCC with known HPV- and p16INK4A(p16)-status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OPSCC cases at the University Hospital of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, Denmark (2000-2014) and at University Hospital of Giessen, Germany (2000-2009) were included. Survival was illustrated with Kaplan-Meier plots. The effect of smoking exposure on survival was evaluated by Cox-regression models. HPV-positivity was defined as positivity for both HPV-DNA and p16. RESULTS: We included 1316 OPSCC cases from 2000-2014 (48% HPV-positive). Smokers had a poorer outcome compared to non-smokers. Considering continuous smoking exposure, adding 10 pack-years of smoking increased hazard ratios irrespective of HPV-status.We observed a tendency to a greater impact on survival for cases with HPV-neg. tumours compared to cases with HPV-pos. tumours at low numbers of pack-years, yet the survival was similar at high numbers of pack-years. There was no significant difference in the impact of HPV-status on survival for non-smokers, however a highly significant difference for smokers. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Smoking-status and number of pack-years at time of diagnosis impact survival for cases with OPSCC independent of HPV-status.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cervical cancer (CC) is caused by a persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection. The cervico-vaginal microbiome may influence the development of (pre)cancer lesions. Aim of the study was (i) to evaluate the new CC screening program in Germany for the detection of high-grade CC precursor lesions, and (ii) to elucidate the role of the cervico-vaginal microbiome and its potential impact on cervical dysplasia. METHODS: The microbiome of 310 patients referred to colposcopy was determined by amplicon sequencing and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: Most patients were referred for colposcopy due to a positive hrHPV result in two consecutive years combined with a normal PAP smear. In 2.1% of these cases, a CIN III lesion was detected. There was a significant positive association between the PAP stage and Lactobacillus vaginalis colonization and between the severity of CC precursor lesions and Ureaplasma parvum. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, the new cervical cancer screening program resulted in a low rate of additional CIN III detected. It is questionable whether these cases were only identified earlier with additional HPV testing before the appearance of cytological abnormalities, or the new screening program will truly increase the detection rate of CIN III in the long run. Colonization with U. parvum was associated with histological dysplastic lesions. Whether targeted therapy of this pathogen or optimization of the microbiome prevents dysplasia remains speculative.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: We investigated the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in a prospective cohort of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) using both p16(INK4a) and HPV DNA, i.e., double positivity, as a definition criterion. Additionally, we examined the association of HPV with survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 280 OSCC patients were analyzed for HPV-positivity using p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH)/LCD arrays, for HPV low and high-risk types. Only patients positive for both p16(INK4a) and HPV DNA were considered as HPV-positive. Survival probabilities and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess HPV association with disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in a competing risks scenario. RESULTS: Specimen from 30 (10.7%) patients were p16+ and HPV DNA+, while 31 (11.0%) were either p16+ or HPV DNA+ only. OS probabilities at five years for HPV-positive and -negative groups were 50.9% (35.4%-73.1%) and 52.9% (47.0%-59.5%), respectively. HPV double positivity influenced neither OS, CSS nor DFS: HR=0.84 (0.43-1.63), 1.64 (0.76-3.54) and 1.13 (0.55-2.35), respectively. CONCLUSION: In contrast to oropharyngeal cancer, the prevalence of HPV in OSCC is low and the presence of HPV does not influence survival outcomes. Hence, there is no evidence to support a parallel transfer of therapy regimen for HPV-positive OPC to OSCC, in terms of therapy de-escalation and/or vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, p16 expression and hypoxia may play important roles in the carcinogenesis, treatment response and toxicities of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this analysis was to assess whether there is any correlation between pre-radiotherapy (RT) anemia, p16 expression and toxicities and local control for patients undergoing definitive therapy. METHODS: 79 HNSCC patients who had undergone radiochemotherapy (RCT) or RT-antibody therapy were retrospectively analyzed. p16 (INK4A) expression was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Factors predisposing for acute side effects were examined by uni- and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: p16 overexpression was detected in 32 cases. Pretreatment anemia was present in one third of patients. Only 5% of patients were characterized by both pre-RT anemia and p16 overexpression. p16 expression was significantly associated with acute grade 3 toxicity. 47% of p16-positive patients developed grade >/= 3 radiodermatitis compared to 26% of p16-negative patients (p = 0.04). A reduced risk of severe skin toxicities was noted for patients with hypoxic blood values before RT. p16 expression was significantly correlated with local control (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: p16 expression is associated with better response to definitive combined treatment (RCT, RT + cetuximab), but also significantly related to acute high-grade toxicity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recognizing the prognostic power differentiating HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) from OPSCC with other causes, the UICC Cancer Staging Manual 8th edition realizes significant changes from the 7th edition. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences of prognostic impact between the 7th and the latest edition of TNM Classification as well as to examine risk factors like extranodal extension (ENE) and lymph node ratio (LNR) for HPV-mediated OPSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study includes 255 patients with OPSCC and initial diagnosis between 2008 and 2015. HPV status was determined according to p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and all patients were classified as defined by 7th and 8th edition of UICC. Prognostic influence of ENE and LNR was analyzed for patients with HPV-mediated OPSCC. RESULTS: 41.2% of the OPSCC were p16-positive. Implementation of the 8th edition of the UICC lead to a better differentiation between the respective stages. Regarding HPV-positive OPSCC, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significantly better overall survival (OS) for patients with a LNR </=10% as well as for patients with negative ENE status (p = 0.004, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: 8th edition of UICC achieves to differentiate properly between the UICC stages. However, the staging rule of ignoring ENE in HPV-mediated OPSCC should be further analyzed. Moreover LNR might be a possible additional prognostic factor - especially regarding HPV-positive tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays an important role in the pathogenesis of penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) in about one third of the affected patients. Initial data indicate that HPV status could facilitate optimised risk stratification and individualised targeted therapy. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is the reference method for detection of HPV DNA. It is unclear if alternatives such as in situ hybridisation (ISH) or various surrogate markers (defined as immunohistochemical detection of p16INK4a, histological subtype, tumour invasion front, koilocytosis) are sufficient to determine HPV status METHODS: In this single centre study on 34 patients with PSCC, multiplex nested PCR and ISH were conducted for HPV detection and identification of HPV DNA genotypes. Various histological criteria and p16INK4a were determined by central review. The influence of different criteria on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) was investigated with the Cox proportional hazards models (FU: 92 mo.). Furthermore, the discriminative qualities of various tumour invasion patterns (i. e., pT-classification 7th vs. 8th ed.) for CSM prediction were compared. RESULTS: Pursuant to PCR assay, HPV DNA was detected in 26 % of patients (n = 9). ISH and the examined histological criteria were of inadequate quality in the prediction of HPV status (p > ;0.3). Test parameters of p16INK4a were calculated as follows: sensitivity 66.7 %, specificity 84 %, positive predictive value 60 %, negative predictive value 87.5 %, overall agreement 79.4 % (Area-Under-Curve: 0.753, p = 0.026). None of the examined HPV criteria significantly influenced CSM. In comparison to the 7th pT-edition, the 8th version was superior in CSM prediction (c-indices 70.2 % vs. 72.9 %). In addition to penile corpora invasion, infiltration of the urethra had no independent predictive value. Regrouping of the corpora invasion patterns, as proposed by us, resulted in an increase in discriminative quality (c-index 77.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to ISH and the examined histological criteria, p16INK4a allows a reasonable prediction of HPV status. Neither HPV DNA nor its surrogate markers independently impacted CSM. As urethral tumour invasion does not independently influence CSM, the recent pT classification can be considered useful for prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour mutational burden (TMB) estimated from whole exome sequencing or comprehensive gene panels has previously been established as predictive factor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Its predictive value for the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiation (cCRTX), a potential combination partner of ICI, remains unknown. METHODS: The accuracy of TMB estimation by an in-house 327-gene panel was established in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) data set. Interference of TMB with outcome after cCRTX was determined in a multicentre cohort of patients with locally advanced HNSCC uniformly treated with cCRTX. Targeted next-generation sequencing was successfully applied in 101 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pretreatment tumour samples. In a subset of cases (n = 40), tumour RNA was used for immune-related gene expression profiling by the nanoString platform. TMB was correlated with TP53 genotype, human papilloma virus (HPV) status, immune expression signatures and survival parameters. Results were validated in the TCGA HNSCC cohort. RESULTS: A high accuracy of TMB estimation by the 327-gene panel was established. High TMB was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of TP53 mutations and immune gene expression patterns unrelated to T cell-inflamed gene expression profiles. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly reduced overall survival in the patient group with high TMB (hazard ratio for death: 1.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-3.14; P = 0.042) which remained significant after correcting for confounding factors in the multivariate model. The prognostic value of TMB was confirmed in the TCGA HNSCC cohort. CONCLUSION: High TMB identifies HNSCC patients with poor outcome after cCRTX who might preferentially benefit from CRTX-ICI combinations.

AB  - AIMS: The aims of the study were (1) to characterize the genetic variability of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype 16 in the E6 region when this genotype is present in multiple infection samples, (2) to assess the prevalence of variants in our region and (3) to analyze the relationship between variants, patients' ages and pathology. METHODS: The Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control Department analyzed samples which were positive for genotype 16 and other genotypes from 2007 to 2013. Variants were assigned to European, Euro-German, Asian, Asian-American or African lineage by sequence analysis. The relationship among variants, age and different types of lesion was studied. RESULTS: In HPV-16 sequence analysis, the European variant was detected in 85.10% of samples, the Asian-American in 7.80%, the African in 4.25% and the Euro-German in 2.83% of specimens. Sequence genetic variability showed 16 nucleotide substitutions. Moreover, non-European variants were mainly found in old women and in isolates from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions since European variants were mainly detected in negative cytologies. CONCLUSION: Multiple infections may take effect on nucleotide substitution and the appearance of recombinant samples. Single gene analysis makes it impossible to detect recombination which has a great influence on drug response and vaccine strategies. Thus, E6 gene analysis would be enough to identify HPV-16 intratypic variants but not to confirm the results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-positive men who have sex with men (HIV+MSM) have an increased risk for anal dysplasia and for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). OBJECTIVES: We determined the positivity rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoea (NG), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and syphilis in HIV+MSM participating in an anal cancer screening programme. METHODS: In total, 852 intra-anal swabs were collected from 503 HIV+MSM between 2012 and 2014. Anal cytology and polymerase chain reaction assays for human papillomavirus (HPV), CT, NG and MG detection were performed. The syphilis status was determined serologically. Risk factors for STIs were explored by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total 20.7% (104 of 503) of the patients had an STI other than HPV within the study period. The most common was CT, found in 10.9%, followed by NG (8.9%) and MG (4.2%). Early syphilis was detected in 4.6% and past syphilis in 44.5% of the HIV+MSM. Eighteen patients (3.6%) had more than one STI episode, and 90.6% of the 127 cases of STIs were asymptomatic. Age, anal HPV infection, abnormal anal cytology and previous syphilis were risk factors for STI. CONCLUSIONS: Anal STIs are frequent and mostly asymptomatic in HIV+MSM participating in anal cancer screening. STI screening should be incorporated into anal cancer screening programmes for HIV+MSM.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the prognostic impact of the width of negative surgical margins (NSM) and associated and preinvasive lesions at the NSM in patients with penile squamous cell cancer (PSC). METHODS: Enrolling 87 patients with NSM who underwent surgery for PSC, the archived margin slides and entirely wax-embedded surgical margins were retrieved from the pathology files. After step sections were cut, margins were stained with antibodies against CK5/6, p16, p53 and Ki-67 and subjected to in situ hybridisation for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). All NSM were histologically examined for squamous hyperplasia (SH), lichen sclerosus (LS) and subtypes of penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN). Then, histological findings were correlated with cancer-specific mortality (CSM, median follow-up 34 months; IQR 6-70). RESULTS: All NSM were negative for high-risk HPV and exhibited SH (p16 and p53 negative, Ki-67 variably positive), LS (p16 negative, variable p53 and Ki-67 positivity) and differentiated PeIN (dPeIN; p16 negative, Ki-67 positive, variable p53 positivity) in 28 (32%), 30 (34%) and 22 (25%) cases, respectively, whereas PeIN subtypes other then dPeIN did not occur. Pathological tumour stage was the only independent predictive parameter with respect to CSM in the multivariable analysis (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SH, LS and dPeIN are frequent histological findings at the NSM of surgically treated PSC. However, neither the width of the NSM nor dPeIN, LS or SH at the NSM influences prognostic outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transcription factor high-mobility AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is involved in stem cell renewal and is expressed in many tumor tissues. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) comprise tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract and are characterized by high recurrence rates that represent a challenge to patient management. The study addresses the potential of HMGA2 as a molecular biomarker for HNSCC patient survival. METHODS: Patients with HNSCC of the larynx, pharynx, tonsils, or oral cavity were recruited in a hospital-based case-control study (n = 202). Quantitative expression of HMGA2 in tumor tissues was measured by RT-PCR. In a 6- to 10-year follow-up, secondary cancers, vital status, and cause of death were ascertained. The HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall, tumor-specific, and progression-free survival were estimated by Cox proportional hazards with HMGA2 expression level as the independent variable. RESULTS: High HMGA2 expression in tumor tissues of HNSCC patients was significantly correlated with negative HPV status (P = 0.01), and associated with shorter overall survival time. In Cox regression modeling, HMGA2 expression yielded a risk increase for overall and tumor-specific death in subsets of HNSCC patients, that is, laryngeal cancer patients (overall survival: HR = 4.00; 95% CI, 1.18-13.62) and in oral cancer patients (tumor-specific survival: HR = 2.88; 95% CI, 1.06-7.84), but not in patients with pharyngeal and tonsillar HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: HMGA2 expression is associated with a risk increase for adverse outcomes in patients with HNSCC of the larynx and oral cavity. IMPACT: The understanding of stem cell signaling in HNSCC may offer new strategies for cancer treatment. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(2); 197-205. (c)2016 AACR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: APOBECs (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptides) are cytidine deaminases that have been implicated in the host defense against viruses by blocking viral replication. They have also been shown to play a role in genome hypermutation in several human cancers. An APOBEC3 hypermutation signature has been discovered in cervical cancer, which is intimately associated with infection by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). At the same time, HPV genomes themselves are subject to DNA editing by APOBECs. Similar to cervical cancer, a proportion of penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is etiologically driven by high-risk HPVs, but very little is known about the role of APOBECs in penile SCC development and progression. METHODS: A series of 34 penile SCCs was analyzed for the expression of APOBEC3A protein by immunohistochemistry. HPV genotyping was carried out using a bead-based multiplex hybridization assay preceded by BSGP5+6+ primer-based amplification. RESULTS: We found a frequent reduction of APOBEC3A protein expression in the invasive parts of the majority of HPV-negative penile SCCs. In contrast, the majority of HPV-positive penile SCCs retained APOBEC3A expression during malignant progression. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that APOBEC3A expression is downregulated during progression towards invasiveness in HPV-negative penile SCC, but maintained in HPV-positive penile SCC. How high-risk HPV-infected tumor cells tolerate high APOBEC3A, which appears to exert tumor suppressive functions in HPV-negative penile SCCs, remains to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the potential prognostic role of tumor cell podoplanin expression in patients treated with resection followed by irradiation or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Podoplanin expression (</=10 % versus > 10 %) and 12 other factors were evaluated in 160 patients for their association with locoregional control (LRC), metastases-free (MFS) and overall survival (OS). Other factors were age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, preradiotherapy (pre-RT) hemoglobin level, tumor site, histological grading, T category, N category, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, extent of resection and concurrent chemotherapy. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status 0-1 (risk ratio, RR: 3.01; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1.42-7.14; p = 0.003), pre-RT hemoglobin levels >/= 7.45 mmol/l (12 g/dl; RR: 2.03; 95 % CI: 1.04-3.94; p = 0.038), oropharyngeal cancer (RR: 1.25; 95 % CI: 1.01-1.55; p = 0.038) and T category T1-2 (RR: 1.81; 95 % CI: 1.24-2.79; p = 0.002) were significantly associated with improved LRC. T category T1-2 (RR: 1.90; 95 % CI: 1.25-3.06; p = 0.002) and N category N0-2a (RR: 5.22; 95 % CI: 1.96-18.09; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with better MFS. Pre-RT hemoglobin levels >/= 7.45 mmol/l (RR: 2.44; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.74; p = 0.007), T category T1-2 (RR: 1.97; 95 % CI: 1.36-3.04; p < 0.001) and N category N0-2a (RR: 2.87; 95 % CI: 1.37-6.61; p = 0.005) were significantly associated with improved OS. Podoplanin expression </= 10 % showed a trend towards improved OS on both univariate (p = 0.050) and multivariate analysis (RR: 1.86; 95 % CI: 0.96-3.59; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Treatment outcomes were significantly associated with performance status, pre-RT hemoglobin level, tumor site and tumor stage. Tumor cell expression of podoplanin </= 10 % showed a trend towards improved OS when compared to podoplanin expression of > 10 %.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To show noninferiority of a limited-excision (resection of the dysplastic lesion only) vs. classical Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ). METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, women with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 were randomized into two groups (1:1). Primary outcome was the rate of negative HPV tests after 6 months, secondary outcomes included cone size, complete resection rates as well as cytological and histological results after 6 and 12 months. A sample size of 1,000 was calculated to show noninferiority of the limited-excision compared to the LLETZ group using a noninferiority margin of 5%. Enrollment was stopped after 100 patients due to slow accrual. RESULTS: Patients in the limited-excision group did not show a lower number of negative HPV tests (78% [LLETZ]-80% [limited-excision]=-2%; 90% confidence interval=-15%, 12%). The limited-excision resulted in a substantially lower cone size (LLETZ: 1.97 mL vs. limited-excision: 1.02 mL; p<0.001) but higher numbers of involved margins (LLETZ: 8% vs. limited-excision: 20%). Although postoperative cytological results slightly differed, histological results were similar in both groups. One limited-excision patient received immediate re-conisation, whereas one patient in each group was scheduled for re-conisation after 6 months. CONCLUSION: The limited-excision could represent a promising option to reduce the surgical extent of conisations while maintaining oncological safety. The trial was not sufficiently powered to reach statistical significance due to early termination. Nevertheless, the study provides important insights in the feasibility of a limited-excision and could serve as a pilot study for future trials.

AB  - In addition to tobacco and alcohol consumption, the two main risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), recent studies have revealed infections with human papilloma virus (HPV) as an additional risk factor for OSCC development. In the field of head and neck malignancies, the prevalence of HPV infections in oropharyngeal cancer (OC) ranges in different studies up to 84%. While HPV infection is discussed as an independent risk factor in this region, its distinguished role in carcinogenesis of tumours localized to the oral cavity remains still uncertain. In this study, we analysed the HPV status in 88 consecutive patients with OSCCs localized anterior of the palatoglossal arch who were treated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University Medical Center Mainz. The HPV status analysis was performed using DNA-PCR and immunostaining of p16 protein. The prevalence of HPV-positive OSCCs was about 6% (5 patients). In 3 patients the HPV subtypes 16/18 were found. No significant differences between the HPV positive and negative patients regarding age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption, localization and TNM level could be detected. Contrary to other studies focussing on cancers of the lingual and palatine tonsil, the prevalence of HPV infections was much lower in the oral cavity. Therefore HPV infection might play a less important role in oral carcinogenesis.

AB  - HPV infection is considered as an independent risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Due to highly variable prevalence results in numerous studies, it is, however, difficult to estimate the relevance of HPV infection as risk factor for a specific patient collective. This study aimed to elucidate the disparities of HPV prevalence by analyzing socioeconomically and regionally different patient collectives. Two age, gender, stage and tumor location matched cohorts of 18 private health insured (PHIP) and 16 statutory health insured patients (SIP) suffering from an oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and treated at a university hospital were screened for p16 overexpression and HPV infection by immunohistochemistry and PCR. In addition 85 HNSCC patients of an otolaryngology private practice (PPP) in a rural area were screened for p16 overexpression and positive cases were tested for HPV infection. HPV prevalence was 72.2% in the PHIP collective in comparison to 25.0% (p = 0.015) in the SIP collective with a significantly improved 5-year overall survival (p = 0.003) of the PHIP collective. The total HPV prevalence of PPP group was 7.1% with the highest infection rate in tonsillar carcinomas (33.3%) and a larger percentage of female patients in the HPV positive group (p = 0.037). This study shows that variable HPV infection rates in HNSCC can be caused by the selection of particular patient collectives, which suggest taking socioeconomic and regional factors into account for a decision on HPV testing, if it is not performed on a routine basis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lymph node ratio (LNR) is an established predictor in different entities of carcinoma, including head and neck malignancies. In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), lymph node involvement differs between human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative tumours. Herein, we evaluate the impact of HPV association on the concept of LNR. METHODS: 88 surgically treated patients were included in this retrospective chart review. HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC were evaluated for prediction of outcome by LNR separately. The endpoints were 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: The OS of all patients was 60.1%. In univariate analysis, LNR was a significant predictor of overall survival rate (P=.008) in OPSCC independently of the HPV status, as well as extracapsular spread (ECS). T-classification was only a significant predictor in the univariate analysis in HPV-positive OPSCC carcinoma. However, in the multivariate analysis LNR remained predictor of prognosis in all OPSCC and in HPV-negative OPSCC. In patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, only T-classification reached significance to predict OS. CONCLUSION: Prognosis of primarily operated HPV-positive patients might be more dependent on the extent of primary tumour site, whereas prognosis of HPV-negative patients is based more on cervical metastatic spread, represented by LNR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Penile cancer is a rare but often lethal tumour disease, especially in the metastatic stage. Most data on prognostic factors for penile cancer are based on small patient cohorts, and even meta-analyses are mostly limited in terms of patient numbers. There is a lack of sufficient parameters to predict the metastatic risk of these tumours. Furthermore, the role of the HPV status for the prognosis, and, in this regard, of p16INK4a is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 236 patients from an international multicentre cohort were analysed with regard to histological subtypes, HPV and p16 status, and other clinical parameters. The HPV status was only graded as HPV-positive if HPV was detected by PCR and the p16 status defined by immunochemistry was positive. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method as well as the log-rank test and a univariable and multivariable analysis using the Cox regression model. RESULTS: A positive HPV status was not a significant parameter for either metastasis-free (MFS), tumour-specific (CSS) or overall survival (OS). p16-positive tumours showed a significantly better MFS (p=0.026), which was also confirmed in the subgroup analysis of HPV-negative tumours (p=0.037) without differences in CSS or OS. In the usual type, there was also a trend towards an improved MFS, but without statistical significance (p=0.070). p16-positive tumours were associated with a highly significantly better MFS (hazard ratio 0.3; p=0.004) in the multivariable Cox regression, while patients with a pT1b tumour stage or advanced lymph node metastasis showed a significantly worse survival. In the multivariable analysis of HPV-negative tumours, p16 status was also confirmed as an independent predictor of MFS (Hazard ratio 0.2; p=0.007). CONCLUSION: HPV status alone seems to be lacking prognostic relevance. In contrast, p16 status was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor. Thus, the expression of p16INK4a is associated with a significantly better MFS. Especially in HPV-negative tumours, the p16 status should be evaluated with regard to the prognostic value and thus also with a view to the treatment decision.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The decision between definitive radio(chemo)therapy (RCT) or a surgical strategy, i. e. surgery +/- adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy for optimal treatment of oropharyngeal cancer is highly debated. Human papillomavirus(HPV)-related tumours are a distinct entity associated with p16 overexpression. While this represents a major prognostic factor, its predictive significance remains unknown. RESULTS: Among 183 consecutive unselected patients treated between 2009 and 2013 with a state-of-the-art surgical procedure +/- adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy or definitive RCT including intensity-modulated radiotherapy, 3‑year disease-free survival (DFS) was 74 vs. 57%, respectively (p = 0.007). When focusing on p16+ patients (49%), there was no significant difference in tumour control rate between surgery +/- radio(chemo)therapy and the definitive RCT group (3-year DFS 83 vs. 82%, respectively; p = 0.48). However, delayed severe dysphagia was significantly lower in favour of definitive RCT: 35 vs. 4%, respectively; p = 0.0002. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight distinct outcomes after definitive RCT or initial surgical treatment according to p16 status, which should thus be considered during the decision process.

AB  - This study is a retrospective analysis of clinico-pathological data to investigate survival rates of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated with different modalities in a single academic head and neck cancer center in different time intervals. Altogether, 287 patients with OPSCC were included in this comparison. Patients were analysed during two different treatment periods: Group 1 included patients treated mainly with primary surgery +/- adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy between 2002 and 2007, while Group 2 included patients treated with organ/function-preservation protocols if indicated. Main outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Between 2002 and 2007, early-stage OPSCC showed a 5-year OS of 75% compared to that of 86% between 2008 and 2013. Locally advanced OPSCC showed a 5-year OS of 66% between 2002 and 2007 compared to that of 74% between 2008 and 2013. RFS in early-stage OPSCC was 48% between 2002 and 2007 in contrast to that of 77% between 2008 and 2013. With locally advanced OPSCC, RFS was 55% between 2002 and 2007 compared to that of 56% between 2008 and 2013. These differences were statistically not significant. The OS and RFS remained generally unchanged over the analysed time period. There was no significant difference in the outcomes with regards to HPV status and to their treatment modality.

AB  - Genomic alterations are a driving force in the multistep process of head and neck cancer (HNC) and result from the interaction of exogenous environmental exposures and endogenous cellular processes. Each of these processes leaves a characteristic pattern of mutations on the tumor genome providing the unique opportunity to decipher specific signatures of mutational processes operative during HNC pathogenesis and to address their prognostic value. Computational analysis of whole exome sequencing data of the HIPO-HNC (Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology-head and neck cancer) (n = 83) and TCGA-HNSC (The Cancer Genome Atlas-Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma) (n = 506) cohorts revealed five common mutational signatures (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [COSMIC] Signatures 1, 2, 3, 13 and 16) and demonstrated their significant association with etiological risk factors (tobacco, alcohol and HPV16). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified four clusters (A, B, C1 and C2) of which Subcluster C2 was enriched for cases with a higher frequency of signature 16 mutations. Tumors of Subcluster C2 had significantly lower p16(INK4A) expression accompanied by homozygous CDKN2A deletion in almost one half of cases. Survival analysis revealed an unfavorable prognosis for patients with tumors characterized by a higher mutation burden attributed to signature 16 as well as cases in Subcluster C2. Finally, a LASSO-Cox regression model was applied to prioritize clinically relevant signatures and to establish a prognostic risk score for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. In conclusion, our study provides a proof of concept that computational analysis of somatic mutational signatures is not only a powerful tool to decipher environmental and intrinsic processes in the pathogenesis of HNC, but could also pave the way to establish reliable prognostic patterns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPSCC) is generally poor. The aim of this study is to investigate the different therapeutic approaches and identify prognostic factors associated with a worse outcome for patients treated for T4a OPSCC, in order to improve treatment selection for the individual. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 426 patients with T4a OPC treated between 1980 and 2010. Eleven prognostic factors including treatment modality, lymph node staging, and p16 status as a surrogate marker for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection were analyzed. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a significant difference in DSS between N0 and N+ (57.1% versus 26.9%, P < 0.001), primary surgical and primary nonsurgical treatment (52.7% versus 31.4%, P < 0.001), and perinodal invasion (51.7% versus 19.9%, P = 0.011). P16-negative patients tended towards a worse DSS than p16-positive patients (40.2% versus 64.6%, P = 0.126) but responded better to primary surgery than to nonsurgical treatment (71.4% versus 34.0%, P = 0.113). Multivariate analysis identified the N category as an independent prognostic factor for survival. CONCLUSION: The survival of p16-negative patients was worse than p16-positive patients, although they seem to respond better to primary surgery. The strongest independent prognostic factor for T4a carcinomas proved to be the presence of lymph node metastases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to their differing carcinogenesis, prognosis and clinical manifestation, human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been classified separately as two entities since the 8th edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system (UICC 8). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 524 patients with OSCC treated between 2000 and 2016 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital Muenster, Germany, were examined for the detection of HPV type 16-specific DNA (HPV16-DNA), nicotine and alcohol consumption and the influence of therapy on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the annual prevalence of HPV16-DNA-positive OSCC from 40% (n = 12/30) in 2000 to 46% (n = 18/39) in 2016 (p = 0.025, beta = 0.539). Of the HPV16-DNA-positive OSCC, 89% (n = 212) were downgraded on the basis of UICC 8 compared to UICC 7. In the overall collective, frequent alcohol and nicotine (>/= 10 pack years) consumption showed a significant negative influence on OS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.009, respectively). Frequent alcohol consumption was also prognostically relevant in the HPV16-DNA-negative group (p = 0.049). In the HPV16-DNA-positive group, the prognosis for OS according to UICC 8 showed no statistically significant difference between stages I and II (p = 0,481), or between III and IV (p = 0.439). CONCLUSIONS: The current UICC 8 improves the prognostic stratification of OSCC due to the separation of HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors in comparison to UICC 7. However, the prognostic significance of UICC 8 for HPV-associated OSCC is still insufficient. In the future, alcohol and nicotine consumption could influence the UICC classification in order to further improve prognostic significance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) to the vulva with regard to prognosis and local recurrence in patients with vulvar squamous cell cancer (VSCC) is poorly described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the AGO-CaRE-1 study 1618 patients with primary VSCC FIGO stage >/= IB, treated between 1998-2008, were documented. In this retrospective subanalysis, 360 patients were included based on the following criteria: nodal involvement (pN+), known RT treatment and known radiation fields. RESULTS: The majority had pT1b/pT2 tumors (n=299; 83.1%). In 76.7%, R0 resection was achieved. 57/360 (15.8%) N+ patients were treated with adjuvant RT to the groins/pelvis and 146/360 (40.5%) received adjuvant RT to the vulva and groins/pelvis. 157/360 (43.6%) patients did not receive any adjuvant RT. HPV status was available in 162/360 patients (45.0%), 75/162 tumors were HPV+(46.3%), 87/162 (53.7%) HPV-. During a median follow-up of 17.2 months, recurrence at the vulva only occurred in 25.5% of patients without adjuvant RT, in 22.8% of patients with adjuvant RT to groins/pelvis and in 15.8% of patients with adjuvant RT to the vulva and groins/pelvis respectively. The risk reducing effect of local RT was independent of the resection margin status. 50% disease free survival time (50% DFST) indicated a stronger impact of adjuvant RT to the vulva in HPV+ compared to HPV- patients (50% DFST 20.7 months vs. 17.8 months). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant RT to the vulva was associated with a lower risk for local recurrence in N+ VSCC independent of the resection margin status. This observation was more pronounced in patients with HPV+ tumors in comparison to HPV- tumors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study reports the oncological outcome of a non-selected series of patients with human papillomavirus(HPV)-positive and -negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) preferentially managed with upfront surgery. METHODS: Consecutive OSCC cases (n = 378) diagnosed from 2000 to 2010 in our department were evaluated for risk factors, HPV association, therapy and overall survival (OS). HPV status was determined by combined DNA and p16 testing, and treatment was defined as the first course of treatment with any kind of surgery (upfront surgery) or primary chemoradiotherapy. OS of HPV-associated and HPV-negative patients was compared using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The majority of OSCC patients (215 of 361; 69.5%) received upfront surgery as first-line treatment in curative intent. The 5-year OS rate in patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors were 81.1 and 39.7%, respectively. Upfront surgery in HPV-negative (p < 0.001) and HPV-positive patients (p = 0.05) resulted in improved OS only in advanced stages. Multivariate analysis for patients revealed age in HPV-associated OSCC as an independent predictor for improved survival, and age, performance, N status and therapy as independent predictors in HPV-negative OSCC. CONCLUSIONS: Non-selected OSCC patients amenable to curative therapy show poor 5-year OS. The benefit of upfront surgery remains unclear. A younger patient age was the main factor for a better outcome in patients with HPV-associated OSCC.
