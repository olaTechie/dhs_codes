AB  - Based on experiences and reflections reported by health professionals, the aim of this study was to critically analyze the actions, situations, and decisions in healthcare services that involve breastfeeding, examining aspects that favor or limit its possibilities. This was a qualitative study based on the conceptual framework of vulnerability and healthcare, using focus groups with 25 healthcare professionals participating in the Committee on Breastfeeding in Londrina, Parana State, Brazil. The material was produced with a comprehensive format, focusing on questions that involved the breastfeeding process and its approaches and decisions. The study raises issues for understanding how the way mothers and families deal with breastfeeding is linked to organization of the practices and individual and social aspects, requiring integration between practical and technical/scientific knowledge. The article portrays the complexity of healthcare for women and children, allowing an enhanced approach to routine healthcare and the related strategies for breastfeeding.

AB  - In this chapter, we discuss resilience from a social or macrolevel perspective in order to look at how communities confront large-scale disasters and calamities: earthquakes, floods, drought, economic crisis, state repression, systematic terrorism, etc. As this list indicates, there are two basic types of collective adversity: natural disasters and those brought about by humans or society in general. In both cases, poverty aggravates the severity of the disaster and the number of victims. Nonetheless, it has been possible to create an overarching framework to characterize the positive factors or pillars of community resilience, on the one hand, and those conditions that inhibit or weaken it (antipillars), on the other. The reality of Latin America, impacted daily by natural or social disasters, has offered a rich forum for experimentation. Observing the effects of these frequent hardships and the responses of different communities has allowed us to continuously refine our framework and create a hierarchy of key factors based on these observations.

AB  - A growing literature focuses on the relative academic success of Vietnamese refugee children after their arrival in North America, in spite of their socioeconomic and language barriers. Much of this success is attributed to family practices that promote and provide opportunities for academic excellence. Unlike most contemporary research that focuses on psychological variables and factors that are correlated with refugee children's successes, this chapter will discuss the important role that Vietnamese mothers, living in a community in the Canadian Maritimes, play in fostering academic resilience and coping with life stressors such as language, cultural, and socioeconomic obstacles of their children.

AB  - It is estimated that 11% of Portuguese children under 6 years old exhibit Special Educational Needs and 37% of abused and/or abandoned children, under the tutelar proceeding in 1996, were also under six years old. The existence of children considered at risk and vulnerable, when it comes to their psychosocial health and quality of life, implies a continued questioning of the factors that lead to those situations, as well as a challenge to those who work with these children, and must find ways to match educational practices to the children's needs. Intervention, with children at risk, in the area of Resilience and Health Promotion has been one of the most effective programs in preventing risk behavior in adolescence. This article assumes the multidimensionality of the resilience and health promotion concepts, and presents an empirical investigation aiming to the identification and specification of the importance of those dimensions in the development of educational practices among preschool teachers. We will refer to a transversal and exploratory study using a questionnaire, involving 274 subjects, 164 working in Alentejo and 110 in Algarve. Through multiple correspondence analyses, followed by a hierarchical classification technique, it was possible to identify two types/classes of resilience and health promoting educators: more and less promoting. The results suggest that, in order to consider a teacher as belonging to the more promoting type, it is not obligatory that there are children at risk integrated in his/her class. Also, there seems to be no relation between the subject of Health Promoting during the teachers education and a more resilience and health promotion oriented practice. However, the following variables are considered important to an educational practice aiming to the health and resilience promotion: working in the public schools; working in a network of Health-Promoting Schools (NHPS); having Health Education integrated in the curriculum; and the support of the Health Services.

AB  - Children's rights to health are enshrined in a multitude of conventions, declarations, and policies. These rights are invoked, and thwarted, individually and collectively, through the judiciary as well as policy and practice. The rights of children have been given increasing prominence in recent years. The focus of much work, especially in the UK, has been on the civil and political rights of children. There is increasing application of a human rights framework to socio-economic and cultural rights, including child health, although more often from 'developing' country contexts, and it is increasingly accepted that civil and political rights and socio-economic and cultural rights are indivisible. Although human rights and child rights grow in importance internationally and are often 'universally' set out, they are not always universally accepted. The author of this chapter begins by summarizing the structures that set out the health rights of children and then goes on to consider the agency that is required to make their substantive rights to health a practical reality, before examining in more detail the experiences of young homeless people in relation to how and where they live affects on their realization of their rights to mental health. It is argued that there are sites in which health rights may be invoked, and thwarted. For children in transitory spaces of care, it is particularly challenging for them to invoke their rights to health. The primary data quoted here were collected as part of a research project conducted with Helen Taylor, Bob Broad, and Panos Vostanis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper reviews recent research findings and empirically investigates resiliency and vulnerability factors within two Native American communities. The primary factors under consideration are related to American Indian psychosocial factors. This project is an exploratory investigation of pathology and wellness for understudied American Indians, and it examines the nature of resiliency and risk for American Indians. The factors under investigation include adversarial growth, spirituality, ethnic identity, communal identity, social support, historical trauma, stressors experienced, hope, quality of life, and general psychological status for American Indians sampled. Numerous statistically significant relationships emerged, providing empirical support for culturally embedded aspects of resiliency among American Indians. The most salient resiliency factors for Native American/American Indians, in order of statistical significance, were: social support, hope, general resilient coping abilities, traditional cultural and spiritual practices, ethnic pride/enculturation, and communal mastery. Higher levels of protective factors were associated with higher levels of adversarial growth and lower levels of reported unpleasant affect, affective Historical Loss, and scores on psychological distress. Hope scores, Brief Resiliency Coping scores, and Communal Mastery were each found to predict significant proportions of variance in adversarial growth scores, and significant relationships were found to exist between the observed protective factors. Hope, Social Support, Communal Mastery, and Enculturation were found to moderate the relationship between the experience of stressful life events and Adversarial Growth, Psychological Distress indicators, and Quality of Life Ratings. Due to the large amount of significant results observed, exploratory factor analyses were conducted and scales based on these analyses were used in linear regression models. Enculturation, tribal spirituality and participation, as well as Communal Mastery were all found to be cultural factors that predicted significant amounts of the variance in each of the combined dependent variable estimates. Qualitative information regarding resiliency within these communities was also collected, and it provided a powerful portrayal of "Reziliency" or resiliency among American Indians.

AB  - Resilience enables individuals to survive the horrors of war and other such tragedies. This article draws on personal reflections of living in the post-Taliban period in Afghanistan and a review of the literature to explore resilience processes that may be present in the Afghan population. Adverse factors that Afghan children and families face include: destruction of infrastructure, danger, traumatic experiences, post traumatic stress disorder, political and ideological commitment. The protective factors that may have enabled them to survive, and subsequently rebuild in the face of multiple challenges are absolute faith in Allah (God), family support and community support. Understanding more about the kinds of adversities they face and the nature of their protective processes gives healthcare professionals a basis for working with them to improve their health and wellbeing.

AB  - We propose that psychological resilience is a culturally embedded construct. This implies the existence of indigenous resilience factors that moderate the relationships between the unique environmental challenges and the culturally constructed adjustment outcomes. These processes and/or factors might be informed by the prevailing beliefs and practices of the community. Indeed, our search for cultural beliefs and practice of Singaporeans yielded a set of related resilience factors: (1) a belief that the self is malleable, (2) emotional self regulation, (3) coping flexibility and (4) religiosity. This model of Asian resilience was found to predict Asian Subjective Well-being; a measure constructed using indigenous input from the Chinese in Singapore. These results support the culturally embedded nature of psychological resilience and subjective well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To analyze gender relations perceived by male adolescents a how they contribute to making them more vulnerable to pregnancy during adolescence. Method(s): Qualitative study carried out in Campo Grande, Midwestern Brazil, in 2003. Subjects were 13 male adolescents under 20 years of age, fathers of an only child aged up to 11 months whose mother was in the same age group as them. Semi-structured interviews were carried out, tape recorded and transcribed. Thematic content analysis was carried out. Result(s): Gender stereotypes were identified in which the role of leader, provider, and sexually active was stressed and the role of caregiver was rejected. These roles seemed consolidated especially in the subjects' perspective regarding paid employment as a marker of their male condition as well as of a family provider. Adolescents' leadership prevailed in the relationship with the mother of their child especially in taking initiative in sexual intercourse and the use of contraceptives. They considered that pregnancy was unexpected and happened "by chance". However, fatherhood was experienced as a definite evidence of their status as adult men. Conclusion(s): Male adolescents showed to be vulnerable to fatherhood due to gender socialization following traditional patterns. This was evidenced by the inexistence of roles related to self care and care for others, and early playing roles of male sexual dominance, of father and family provider in order to grow up and become a man.

AB  - This study examined the influence of participation in an adventure education program on participants' perceived level of empowerment and resilience, assess the relationship between specific program characteristics and these variables, and understand how participants interpret their experience with regard to empowerment and resilience. Psychological empowerment and resilience was measured before and after participation in an Outward Bound course. Semi-structured interviews were conducted four- to six-months after course completion in an effort to better understand how participants interpret their experience relative to empowerment and resilience. Subjects for this study consisted of participants who completed an Outward Bound course during the summer 2007. Students enrolled in a lower-division general education course at Indiana University served as a comparison group. Study instruments included a modified version of Spreitzer's (1995) empowerment scale, Wagnild and Young's (1993) Resilience Scale, and Characteristics of the Experience Scale (Sibthorp, 2000). Data were analyzed using ANCOVA and repeated measures ANOVA to determine overall differences in the dependent variables following participation in Outward Bound. Correlation was used to determine the relationship between program characteristics and outcomes of empowerment and resilience. For the interview analysis, significant phrases pertaining to empowerment and resilience were identified, coded and formulated into meanings, and clustered into emerging themes. A significant positive increase in both perceived psychological empowerment and resilience was found for the Outward Bound group. No significant differences were obtained for the comparison group. Characteristics of the experience most highly correlated with empowerment were (1) opportunities to develop/practice skills; (2) responsibilities participants had; and (3) help received from the group and staff. "Debriefings" were the component most highly correlated with both empowerment and resilience. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative results. Feelings of accomplishment and a sense of achievement were frequently described by participants as contributing to outcomes related to both empowerment and resilience. Changes in participants' behavior following and attributed to their Outward Bound course were also captured and ranged from subtle to dramatic. Results of this study not only capture whether change occurred in participants, but also offer information about how that change occurred, as well as what behavioral changes participants exhibited after and as a result of their experience.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the level of resilience of people aged > or = 60 years in Sweden and Thailand. In a randomized sample of 422 people in Sweden and a convenience sample of 200 people in Thailand, the level of resilience was measured by using the Resilience Scale. A chi(2)-analysis was used for the differences between proportions. The relationships between the background variables and the resilience scores were analyzed by using stepwise multiple linear regression. The mean scores of resilience were 144 for the Swedish participants and 146 for the Thai participants. The two samples differed in their background characteristics. The Thai participants were more likely to be women, to be widowed, and to have more children, while among the Swedish participants, more women were married and more participants were aged > or = 80 years. Despite different background characteristics, the Swedish and the Thai participants' scores were almost the same on the Resilience Scale. More studies are necessary to address aspects of gender and ethnicity in relation to resilience.

AB  - Scope and Method of Study. Exploratory Research Study. Findings and Conclusions. In this study Resilience was regressed on Enculturation, Self-Esteem, Subjective Well-Being, and Social Support from Family and Friends. The researcher's findings demonstrated that 7% of the total variance in Resilience was explained by Enculturation. Further, 33% of the total variance in Resilience was accounted for by Enculturation, Self-Esteem, and Social Support from Family and Friends, while 34% of the total variance in Resilience was contributed by Enculturation, Subjective Well-Being, and Social Support from Family and Friends. However, Social Support from Friends served as the strongest predictor considering all variables. Additionally, the correlation coefficients tended to reach statistical significance. Notably, results demonstrated a large, negative relationship between Self-Esteem and Subjective Well-Being [r=-.50, p<.01]. A medium, positive relationship between Social Support from Friends and Resilience [r=.48, p<.01, 23% shared variability]. This study demonstrated how the experiences of American Indian adolescents living in urban settings need to be further explored, especially in regards to social support from friends. The role of culture assessed by level of enculturation appeared to operate differently among urban American Indian adolescents. Specifically, culture appeared important but the role of social support from friends remained as the strongest predictor of resilience. It is concluded that the role of friends may be especially critical in urban settings, as tribal communities and resources are less prominent and accessible in urban areas. Implications are provided in terms of prevention within school systems and among tribal communities and mental health professionals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This work discusses a pilot study of a research project investigating the bio-socio-demographic profile of young people (age 14-24) attending public schools in Fortaleza (Ceara-Brazil). The aim is to investigate indicators of social risk and protective factors associated with conditions of social vulnerability, including economic, educational, work, and housing conditions, among others. Here we present a descriptive analysis of a minor sample (n = 64). The main risk factors are high school failure and need to stop school attendance to work and contribute to the family income. The main protective factors are related to self-esteem, self-efficacy, and perception of life chances. The results may reflect that positive resources are available and could help these young people mitigate obstacles in a resilient way. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The United States continues to undergo dramatic changes regarding the ethnic distribution of young people in the population (see Cauce, Cruz, Corona, & Conger, 2011). Demographic data reveal that minority youth make up an increasing portion of the overall citizenry of the United States and this trend is expected to continue until there is no longer a clear ethnic majority group in the country as a whole. These population shifts bring to the fore both scientific interest and policy concerns related to minority youth. Especially important will be new theoretical insights, research findings, social programs, and informed policies that promote the successful development of this segment of the population. These new initiatives are particularly important inasmuch as ethnic minority youth are at relatively high risk for a variety of negative developmental outcomes. These difficulties include increased risk for antisocial behavior and involvement with the criminal justice system, emotional problems, early initiation into sexual activities and childbirth, obesity and physical illness, early death, and school drop-out (Cauce et al., 2011). Simply put, the most rapidly increasing portion of the under 20 population in the United States faces serious challenges in the process of transitioning from adolescence to a successful adulthood. Finding ways to cope more effectively with these challenges will generate major benefits for minority youth, their families, and the country as a whole. In this chapter we focus on two aspects of these issues. First, we report early findings from a study of Mexican-origin youth and their families that examine pathways to successful development despite the significant adversities often faced by Latinos. Second, we recognize that a successful transition from adolescence to adulthood typically begins during the early teen years. That is, we expect that the supports and stresses experienced by young people as they begin their adolescent years often set the tone for the next decade of their lives and beyond. Indeed, previous research on human development across the life course demonstrates that multiple dimensions of risk and resilience emerge during childhood, become intensified during the rapid social and biological changes of adolescence, and, in that process, impact success or failure during the transition to adulthood (e.g., Laub & Sampson, 2003; Luthar, 2003). These findings emphasize the importance of identifying mechanisms of risk and resilience during early or emerging adolescence as a basis for understanding the processes through which adolescents do or do not make a successful transition to the adult years. To address these issues we use data from the California Families Project (CFP), a study of Mexican-origin children and their families living in California.

AB  - In this chapter, we explore the contribution physics can make to our understanding of resilience, showing how the concept can be understood and the need to pay careful attention to the context in which it is found. To examine the application of this understanding of resilience, we will discuss the case of child and adolescent labor in Brazil. Controversially, we show that child labor is not always a sign of significant adversity for all working children, but instead, in specific contexts, may be a contributor to children's capacity to function normally. A clearer definition of resilience, building on principles from physics, makes it much clearer how this can be the case. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Child protection in general and psychosocial support activities in particular for orphans, separated children, and youth (OSCY) in Aceh had started long before the area was hit by the double catastrophes: the earthquake and the giant waves of tsunami that took place on December 26, 2004. Organizations such as UNICEF and Save the Children have been operating in the area since 1976 to help reduce the trauma experienced by thousands of children as a result of armed confrontations between the Indonesian armed forces and the Aceh separatist movement. The influx of hundreds of helping organizations along with voluntary social workers immediately after the tsunami was realized because the magnitude of destruction had made their presence highly needed. Despite the fact that helping organizations have conducted an all-out effort to provide their services, a lot of work still has to be done to help return the tsunami survivors back to normal life. A community based approach should always be considered in designing all programs intended to support the livelihood of the OSCY and their caregivers. Community youth centers are recommended to provide continued psychosocial support for OSCY. Many future programs for OSCY can be implemented in the centers, such as to provide knowledge on life transition from play to work, to instill religious and social norms as important sources of social capital, and to boost their spirit of life and self-confidence. These are all preparations for the OSCY that would lead them to become fully responsible adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1-Identify adolescent-specific vulnerabilities and potential developmental benefits in international research. 2- Describe ethically acceptable approaches to working with vulnerable youth worldwide (with specific application to street-involved youth), including maximizing developmental benefits and building supports for vulnerabilities into research procedures. METHOD(S): Adolescents, as a group, are considered to be vulnerable research subjects, and ethics review committees place i ncreased restrictions on research with minor adolescents. While this approach protects adolescents from potential research harms, it also deprives both individual adolescents and adolescents as a group of the benefits of research. This group-based approach to vulnerability also fails to recognize the many different ways in which adolescents can be vulnerable, and discounts potential developmental benefits of research. Using a case-based approach, this workshop will (1) provide the participants with a newer approach to addressing adolescent vulnerabilities and benefits in international research; and (2) specifically address vulnerabilities related to street youth in low income settings. Part 1 will provide an overview of adolescent vulnerabilities in international research and will provide a conceptual framework and practical tools to address adolescent vulnerabilities in research protocols and when working with research ethics committees. Key to addressing vulnerability is to move from the group-based approach to vulnerability, in which adolescents who have not reached the age of majority in their jurisdiction are considered vulnerable, to a characteristics-based approach to vulnerability, in which specific characteristics of adolescents (cognitive capacity, access to resources, illness) make them vulnerable. Once specific characteristics are identified as causing vulnerability, then it is possible for research procedures to support adolescents in ways in which they are vulnerable. Cases will explore different types of vulnerabilities. Part 2 will specifically consider the vulnerabilities of street youth world-wide, and provide examples of ways research can support these vulnerabilities from research with street youth in North America and western Kenya. Challenges specific to street youth include the process of informed consent for minors to participate in research, provision of appropriate compensation without coercion, and obstacles to accessing care. Innovative approaches to adolescent consent include working with the local government agencies responsible for vulnerable children and child wellbeing (e.g. District Children's Officer) and performing a formal assessment of comprehension of the implications of participation in the study. Pros and cons to different approaches to compensation will be discussed. Specific research procedures to reduce coercion and ensure fair and equitable recruitment include community engagement and partnerships, and the use of street outreach workers. CONCLUSION(S):Adolescent access to the benefits of research is an issue of justice. Adolescents differ from adults in biology, social status, developmental capacity and behavior, and therefore research results from adult studies are often not applicable to adolescent populations. Although research on difficult issues such as HIV and reproductive health, injury and violence are necessary to advance the health of adolescents, few research resources are devoted exclusively to adolescents, and adolescents are often excluded from relevant research studies that involve adults. Ethical and creative approaches to addressing adolescent vulnerability in the research contexts are needed to expand adolescent access to research.

AB  - Background: Children are most vulnerable to any disaster, particularly in poor and developing countries. Historically, Haiti has been affected by many disasters, including natural, man-made, technological, hazardous, and infectious outbreak. Hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) provides for a systematic approach to risk-stratifying potential hazards orphanages and schools may face. Risks associated with each hazard are prioritized to optimize planning, mitigation, response, and recovery. Objective(s): To identify and risk-stratify hazards specific to each orphanage. * To make recommendations on prioritization of mitigation activities to build resiliency to these hazards. Method(s): A cross sectional, qualitative study, conducted in Haiti by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Emergency Management Team along with Harvard Affiliated Disaster Medicine Fellowship in April 2012. Six orphanages under the Child in Hand program (CiH) were identified and an HVA was done individually for each. Data were collated using a modified version of the Kaiser Permanente HVA tool. Analysis was completed using a systematic approach. First, historical data were researched to determine probability. Second, leaders were interviewed at each orphanage regarding frequency of specific events, human impact, and operational impact, and response resources available. Third, site surveys were completed to observe processes such as water treatment, sanitation, site condition, and other physical hazards. Result(s): The HVAs demonstrated that at all CiH sites there is an extreme lack of resources, with most children living at poverty level. The HVAs revealed a severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health care, shelter, and education. In some centers this results not only from lack of resources but also access to services. In our observational and relative risk assessment at each facility, some keep children healthier with simple changes of practice. At each site we noted observed numerous physical hazards which could be easily mitigated with limited resources. Conclusion(s): The HVA can assist non-governmental organizations like CiH in developing a prioritized and sustainable improvement plan for Haitian orphanages. Over time, we hope environment, daily life, and the future for children of Haiti improves despite complex issues facing the country as a whole. (Figure Presented).

AB  - This chapter discusses asset-based coping as one way of dealing with vulnerability. In the South African context typified by diversity and a majority of cultural groups valuing the ubuntu principle, coping with vulnerability often implies community-based responses. It is typically found that an individual will rely on extended family, the immediate community, or a combination of these. More often than not, already scarce resources and external assistance are generously shared with others who are similarly in need of resources and support. Even though the initial study focused on coping with HIV & AIDS, this chapter relates to vulnerability in the broader sense of the word, touching on phenomena beyond HIV&AIDS that are often associated with the outcome of the pandemic. More specifically, the author's aim with this chapter is to discuss how asset-based coping can be relied upon when facing challenges and adversity. Therefore, by applying specific findings obtained within the context of coping with HIV & AIDS, the author attempts to contemplate a proposal that other forms of vulnerability may be addressed in the same manner.

AB  - A Mother Baby Psychiatric Unit poses unique challenges in psychiatric practice owing to the vulnerability of the mother and the infant/fetus and risks due to - 1) Impact of mental illness and the various risks it confers on the mother and infant 2) Treatment including rapid tranquilisation or restraint in mothers who are disturbed and risk to themselves and others 3) The risk imparted by early childhood trauma on current mother infant relationship 4) Psychosocial issues determining placement of the infant and need for supervision in mothering and 5) the role of parenting interventions among women with severe mental illness to mitigate some of these risks and enhance the mother infant relationship. The symposium which will include data from MB Units around the world has five presenters. Several units also admit pregnant mothers who are mentally ill in MB Units. However, apart from the reproductive safety of psychotropic drugs, there is no systematic research into the risks and effectiveness of other aspects of clinical care. These issues and those arising from a woman's impaired mental capacity to make decisions about obstetric and neonatal care will be discussed in the first presentation. The second presentation will discuss factors associated with high risks for the infant that lead to a decision of social or legal supervision or a placement at discharge from joint psychiatric mother-baby units (MBUs) in France and Belgium, from a database of more than 1300 women. The role of formal risk assessment in detecting risk at the time of admission in order to enhance clinical care and minimise risk will be discussed from anMB unit in India. In low and middle income countries, poor nutrition, breast feeding concerns and poor infant health are additional risks that MB unit staff has to manage in addition to violence and self harm. More and more research is emerging on the role of childhood trauma on current mother infant relationship. The fourth presentation is a study using a tool- The CECA Q: Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse questionnaire (Bifulco et al. 2005), which looks at the role of early trauma on mother infant relationship in women with severe mental illness. There are no structured, evidence-based interventions that guide health professionals to help women with severe mental illness, improve early parenting. The Triple P Positive Parenting Programme provides an opportunity to develop the intervention for women with severe postnatal mental illness. In this presentation, the aims underpinning Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme will be outlined alongside current research in its use. This symposium will hence discuss five dimensions of risk in MBUs and offer suggestions for management and further research.

AB  - The present study explored sources of resilience for 10 Latino family caregivers to relatives suffering from dementia. It sought to capture the experience of Latino family caregivers, focusing on the sources of support, the values and the beliefs that they saw as helping them to cope with their caregiving role. Much of the current literature addressing family caregivers of dementia patients has focused on the negative psychological ramifications of caregiving. Few studies inquiring about sources of support and resilience associated with caregiving have focused specifically on how Latinos experience caregiving responsibilities for relatives. Even fewer have addressed the factors that may contribute to resilience in this population of family caregivers. The participants of the study were recruited at community health centers, churches, and senior day programs that served Latino communities in southern New England. Nine participants were women and one was a man; nine were Puerto Rican and one was Dominican. All were caring for relatives with Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia. In individual semi-structured qualitative interviews, participants were asked about their caregiving experiences; specific questions inquired about factors that promoted their coping as caregivers. The results of the current study support the extant literature, which has indicated that Latinos' decisions to become caregivers to family members are influenced by cultural values and customs. The results also highlighted the significant role that spirituality and family played in fostering resilience for these caregivers. While participants spoke about the challenges of their roles, they all also identified multiple sources of support and described personal growth from their caregiving roles. Relatively few respondents cited that health care providers as offering significant support during their caregiving experience. They expressed a desire for more support by providers and emphasized the need for cultural sensitivity in the healthcare community. The results point to the importance of training healthcare professionals to be better informed and responsive to the cultural values of the Latino community and to the emotional needs of Latino family caregivers. Future research should seek to determine if these findings can be generalized to a broader and more diverse Latino caregiver population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, six resilient participants were interviewed to analyze resilience, where resilience derives, and how to access resilience. The six participants included a Holocaust survivor, a NASA rocket-scientist raised in poverty, a university professor diagnosed quadriplegic as a teenager after a car accident, a Hall of Fame wrestler and world-record holding mountain climber born without arms and legs, a Civil Rights leader who headed the nonviolence movement with Martin Luther King, Jr., and an acclaimed humanitarian photographer triple amputated after stepping on an explosive when photo-journaling the Afghani war. The findings indicated: (a) resilient people gain mentorship from an external support system, embrace a full range of emotions, make a decision to overcome adversity, and find opportunities in adversity for personal and societal transformation; (b) resilience appears to derive from an ineffable source expressed in active engagement rather than passive reflection; and (c) resilience has a universal dimension accessed through various approaches such as imagination and storytelling. This study introduces source of resilience as a term to communicate the tacit dimension of resilience as an integration of cognition, behavior, environment, neurobiology, and soul.

AB  - Youth violence will be one of the most challenging threats to adolescent health in the 21st Century. Building individual and family resilience have proven to be effective prevention measures against youth violence; however, they do not adequately address inequities in violence-related health outcomes among adolescents. To improve health equity, it is imperative that prevention measures not only curtail violence, but also curb its harmful effects --- particularly inequities in vulnerabilities that give rise to inequities in health. Emerging research suggests that building community resilience may support prevention efforts at the individual and family levels while concurrently reducing vulnerability to risk factors for youth violence at the population level. Notwithstanding, the public health literature on community resilience against chronic adversities, such as youth violence, is limited. The public health relevance of this dissertation is that it fills a gap in knowledge on community resilience that could improve health equity. Through a stakeholder-engaged case study, community resilience against gang violence (as an example of youth violence) and its harmful effects was explored in Belize. A social ecological model, human security approach, community-based participatory research, and concept mapping were employed to identify factors of community resilience; to rate their importance for building community resilience; and to articulate how they work with each other to build community resilience. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in a 7-cluster concept map, which was used to develop working theories on how factors work with one another to build community resilience. Working theories support a framework for community resilience with three main areas: Area I, a foundation of "essential building blocks" of survival, livelihood, and dignity through the provision of human security; Area II, a strengthening of community assets and social dimensions facilitated by a sense of community, social capital, and social connectedness; and Area III, a transformation of collective efficacy into community empowerment and collective action towards reducing, adapting to, or recovering from adversity (e.g., gang violence). Future research will include building a case series, which will allow for theory testing and refinement of the framework for community resilience against the chronic adversity of gang violence.

AB  - The notion of risk underlying the concept of vulnerability implies that everyone is potentially vulnerable (or at risk), that is, there is always a chance of developing health problems. The risk is, however, greater for those with the least social status, social capital, and human capital resources to either prevent or ameliorate the origins and consequences of poor physical, psychological, or social health. The completeness and accuracy of information on the health status of the vulnerable populations examined here varies substantially across groups. Methodological work is needed to derive standardized definitions of terms, specify the content and timing for collecting information for minimum basic data sets, and develop uniform standards for evaluating and reporting data quality on the health status of vulnerable populations. The variety of indicators of vulnerable populations examined indicates that during the decade of the 1980s the incidence of serious physical, psychological, and/or social needs increased (at worst) and was unameliorated (at best) for millions of Americans. AIDS emerged as a new and deadly threat from a handful of cases classified as Gay-Related Immune Deficiency in the early part of the 1980s to what now may be over a million Americans who are HIV-positive. The number of homeless has increased an average of 20% a year to estimates now ranging up to one million men, women, or children homeless on any given night to twice that number who may be homeless sometime during the year. Over seven million people immigrated to the United States during the period from 1981 to 1990--an increasing proportion of whom are refugees carrying with them the physical, psychological, and social wounds of war. The number of children abused by family members or other intimates has burgeoned to an estimated 1.6 to 1.7 million per year, and with the greater use of firearms, intentional acts of violence towards oneself or others are becoming increasingly deadly in their consequences. Though fewer Americans smoke, drink, and use illicit drugs in general than was the case earlier in the decade of the 1980s, the use of cocaine (and particularly crack) among hard-core addicts has resulted in increases in the number of drug-related deaths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The incidence of multiple pregnancies with more than two fetuses has significantly increased since the introduction of ovulation agents and assisted reproductive technologies. Over a 15-year period there were 35 triplet pregnancies beyond 24 weeks that delivered at the King Fahad Hospital, an incidence of 1 in 1,099 deliveries. Early diagnosis is important for improving the rate of fetal salvage in triplet pregnancy. These pregnancies were managed on an outpatient basis. Prophylactic interventions were not utilised. A total of 91% of the pregnancies had at least one antenatal complication, pre-term labour being the most common (80%) followed by anaemia (43%). The average gestational age at delivery was 31.7 weeks (SD 4.2 weeks). A total of 94.3% of the patients were delivered by lower segment caesarean section. The mean birth weight of the neonates was 1,552 g (SD 510 g) and mean 5-min Apgar score was 7.6 (SD 0.8). The corrected perinatal mortality rate in the study was 152/1,000. Pregnancy outcome did not vary with birth order or mode of conception. Higher rate of pre-term births among triplet pregnancies make considerable demands on the neonatal intensive care unit. All methods of assisted reproduction should aim at prevention of multifetal pregnancies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: largely a consequence of historical gender differences in labor force attachment in the United States, many women rely on their spouse for health insurance coverage, particularly during late middle age. Prior research finds that this creates a window of vulnerability for women during late middle age who may lose their (older) spouse's employment-based coverage when he retires from the labor force and enrolls in Medicare. However, the few studies that have examined this window of vulnerability have been based primarily on white adults. METHODS: we used the 2004 and 2006 Annual Social and Economic Supplements to the Current Population Survey to examine whether the window of vulnerability exists among non-Hispanic Black, Mexican-origin, and non-Hispanic White women 55 to 64 years of age, and whether similar factors contribute to the vulnerability across these race/ethnic groups. RESULTS: women 55 to 64 years of age married to men 65 years or older had an elevated risk of lacking coverage at a time of life when health problems are common and expensive. Among non-Hispanic White women, their husband's exit from full-time employment accounted for the higher risk, whereas a more complex and systemic set of social factors contributed to the higher risk among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican-origin women. CONCLUSION: ensuring adequate and affordable health insurance coverage among women during late middle age may require additional health care reforms such as extending Medicare eligibility to younger adults or basing Medicare age eligibility on the age of the older partner within a married couple.

AB  - Using data from a cohort of school going children, their households and caregivers (the Amajuba Child Health and Wellbeing Project, ACHWRP) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, we compared demographic characteristics, care burden, health, physical function and social capital of caregivers of orphans (n = 300) with those of non-orphans (n = 298). This analysis presents cross-sectional findings from questions for caregivers that were added for the study's second round, conducted between September 2005 and June 2006. Caregivers of all children were overwhelmingly women (87%). Compared to non-orphan caregivers, caregivers of orphans were on average older (49.5 vs. 45.2 years, p = 0.0002), had fewer years of education (6.7 vs. 7.8 years, p = 0.0042) and were less likely to be married or cohabiting (29% vs. 46%; p < 0.0001). Caregivers of orphans reported caring for more children than those of non-orphans (4.8 vs. 3.8 children, p < 0.0001). A larger proportion of orphan caregivers reported having cared for an ill adult in the previous year (28% vs. 19%), and for that adult to have been a biological child (p = 0.0531). There was a high prevalence (55%) of self-reported poor health among all caregivers; caregivers of orphans were more likely to report poor general health and chronic illness. Although there was a high prevalence of functional impairment (self-reported inability to perform primary activity) among all caregivers (59%), there was no difference between groups. In terms of social capital, although similar proportions of orphan and non-orphan caregivers reported having friends outside the household, orphan caregivers were less likely to have a source of a small emergency loan [51% vs. 63%; adjusted odds ratio: 0.60 (0.41-0.88)]. Our results suggest that orphan caregivers are indeed more vulnerable, and that their particular limitations and needs must be considered when developing strategies for assisting vulnerable households to ensure better support for both caregivers and the children in their care.

AB  - The self-rated health in a sample of adults living in the central area of Sao Paulo, Brazil, was studied by comparing a group of residents in census tracts without social vulnerability, identified using an indicator developed by the SEADE Foundation, and a group of residents in census tracts with middle, high or very high social vulnerability. Subject age and sex were used as control variables while family income, education level, degree of happiness, adequacy of income, satisfaction with the neighborhood and sense of discrimination were the intervening variables selected. After adjustment in the hierarchical model the self-rated health status was inversely associated with social vulnerability, age and sense of discrimination, and directly related to income, education level and degree of happiness. Satisfaction with the neighborhood and adequacy of income lose significance after adjustment. The degree of happiness is the variable with the greatest strength of association with health status even after controlling for other variables.

AB  - The concept of community resilience has gained considerable attention in the global health discussions since the Ebola outbreak of West Africa in 2014-2015. However, there are no measurement models to quantify community resilience. Without measurement models, it is unclear how to test strategies for building community resilience or to describe their likely intended and unintended results and their impact on health outcomes. We propose a measurement model for community resilience with relevant constructs and indicators to measure these constructs. We conducted a scoping review, systematically searching, screening and selecting relevant articles from two bibliographic databases (PUBMED and Google Scholar) for literature using search terms such as "resilience", "community resilience" and "health systems resilience". We screened 500 papers, then completed a full text review of 112 identified as relevant based on their title and abstract. A total of 27 papers and reports were retained for analysis. We then aggregated and synthesised the various definitions of community resilience and the frameworks for understanding these definitions. We identified key constructs from these frameworks and organised these constructs into domains and sub-domains. We proposed indicators to capture aspects of these domains and sub-domains and operationalised these indicators as a measurement model for quantifying community resilience in health systems. We propose a model with 20 indicators to assess community resilience. These indicators tap into various constructs from different theoretical frameworks of community resilience and are useful for assessing the level of knowledge, financial resources, and human, social and physical capital that are needed (or lacking) to respond to any types of shock, including health shock at the community level. This is an initial attempt to describe a multilevel measurement model for quantifying community resilience. This model will help to guide the development and testing of strategies for strengthening community resilience and will require further work to assess its relevance, reliability and validity in different LMIC settings.

AB  - AIM: To synthetize elements of research on concept analyses of resilience; and to propose a definition of resilience to NANDA International (NANDA-I) and International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP((R)) ). BACKGROUND: Nursing classifications represent nursing knowledge that is clinically relevant and in continuous development. INTRODUCTION: Nursing is considered holistic and there is always the need to consider human responses to health and life processes. Continuously there are new and emerging concepts concerning humans and health that should be considered within the organization and delivery of health care as resilience. METHODS: In March 2015, the authors performed a synthesis of the findings of research concept analysis research derived from a systematic literature search of electronic databases (PsycINFO, CINAHL and PubMed). Search terms used in the title were: 'resilience' AND 'analysis' AND 'concept'. Papers written in Portuguese or English were included. FINDINGS: A total of 27 papers were identified and eight papers were included. Of these, seven papers used Walker & Avant's () model and one used Rodger's () model. Resilience emerged as a fundamental concept across the lifespan that is closely related to health and well-being. DISCUSSION: Resilience is a phenomenon of interest for nurses. Similar attributes, antecedents, consequents and definitions were synthesized into a new proposal of a definition of resilience. While some diagnoses related to resilience are classified in NANDA-I, the concept is not included in ICNP((R)) . CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The inclusion of the concept into ICNP((R)) and the update in NANDA-I is a contribution for nursing knowledge through education and for clinical practice, as this could promote the effectiveness of interventions in several contexts.

AB  - Climate change prompts increased urbanization and vulnerability to natural hazards. Urbanization processes are relevant to a right to health analysis of natural hazards because they can exacerbate pre-disaster inequalities that create vulnerability. The 2010 earthquake in Port-au-Prince and the 2005 hurricane in New Orleans provide vivid illustrations of the relationship between spatial inequality and the threats associated with natural hazards. The link between urbanization processes, spatial inequality, and vulnerability to natural hazards is important in terms of an analysis of the right to health; in particular, it provides a basis for arguing that states should prioritize equitable land use and development as a matter of human rights. This article draws on work by geographers, disaster specialists, and international legal scholars to argue that inequitable urbanization processes violate the obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill the human right to health in disaster-prone regions.

AB  - Setting: All 100 health facilities providing maternal services in Moyamba, Sierra Leone, a rural district that experienced a smaller Ebola outbreak than other areas. Objective: To compare trends in antenatal care (the first and fourth visit [ANC1 and ANC4]), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC1) service utilisation before, during and after the Ebola outbreak (2014-2016). Design: Cross-sectional study using secondary programme data. Results: A total of 211 Ebola cases occurred in Moyamba District. The mean number of monthly ANC visits remained stable over time, except for the subset of care provided via outreach visits where, compared with before the outbreak (n = 390), ANC1 visits declined during (n = 331, P = 0.002) and after the outbreak (n = 342, P = 0.03). Most (>97%) deliveries occurred in health facilities, assisted by maternal and child health aides (>80%). During the outbreak, the mean number of community-based deliveries per month declined from 31 to 21 (P = 0.03), and the mean number of deliveries performed by midwives increased from 49 to 78 (P < 0.001) compared with before the outbreak. Before, during and after Ebola, there was no significant change in the mean number of live births (respectively n = 1134, n = 1110, n = 1162), maternal PNC1 (respectively n = 1110, n = 1105, n = 1165) or neonatal PNC1 (respectively n = 1028, n = 1050, n = 1085). Conclusion: In a rural district less affected by Ebola transmission than other areas, utilisation of maternal primary care remained robust, despite the outbreak.

AB  - Through loss- and gain-of-function experiments in knockout and transgenic mice, Forkhead box O (FOXO) family transcription factors have been demonstrated to play essential roles in many biological processes, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Osteogenic differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts is a well-organized process that is carefully guided and characterized by various factors, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), beta-catenin, osteocalcin (OCN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Accumulating evidence suggests multiple interactions among FOXO members and the differentiation regulatory factors listed above, resulting in an enhancement or inhibition of osteogenesis in different stages of osteogenic differentiation. To systematically and integrally understand the role of FOXOs in osteogenic differentiation and explain the contrary phenomena observed in vitro and in vivo, we herein summarized FOXO-interacting differentiation regulatory genes/factors and following alterations in differentiation. The underlying mechanism was further discussed on the basis of binding types, sites, phases and the consequent downstream transcriptional alterations of interactions among FOXOs and differentiation regulatory factors. Interestingly, a bidirectional effect of FOXOs on balancing osteogenic differentiation was discovered in MSCs. Moreover, FOXO factors are reported to be activated or suppressed by several context-dependent signalling inputs during differentiation, and the underlying molecular basis may offer new drug development targets for treatments of bone formation defect diseases.

AB  - Globally, orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) affected/infected by HIV/AIDS face many health risks, including malnutrition, early/unprotected sex, early forced marriage, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance abuse, child labor, and high rates of mental health problems. We conducted formative research on mental health issues and HIV/STI risk behavior in Kasarani, a large slum in Nairobi, to guide the development of future interventions. Collaborating with a local community hospital, we used focus groups in the community to gather information that was used to generate a survey of 261 OVCs aged 13-18 years. Focus groups converged in deeming that OVCs were a high-risk group, and girls were especially at higher health risk. Living within an impoverished environment makes these girls vulnerable to marginalization and exploitation. Specific concerns for girls included peer pressure, depression, suicidal ideation, sexual relationship with infected partners, lack of health education (specifically HIV/STI prevention information), and sexual exploitation by older men.Copyright © 2018 Policy Studies Organization

AB  - BACKGROUND: Until now, there is scarcity of information regarding resilience, religiosity and religious coping among adolescent refugees. Currently, most researches emphasize on the physical, psychological and social distresses experienced by refugees while overlooking these crucial aspects, that is, resilience and coping. AIM: The study aimed to examine resilience and its association with religiosity and religious coping among adolescent refugees living in Malaysia. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in five community-based learning centres in Malaysia from July 2019 till December 2019. A total of 152 refugees, aged 13 to 19-years-old, were recruited. The study gauged resilience using the 14-Item Resilience Scale (RS-14), the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL) for religiosity and the Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE) for religious coping. RESULTS: The majority of adolescent refugees portrayed moderate levels of resilience (43.5%). The study highlighted the interconnectedness between resilience and intrinsic religiosity (IR) (p < .001), as well as, positive (p < .001) and negative (p = .010) religious coping. Additionally, the results demonstrated that certain sociodemographic factors could potentially confound resilience, namely, countries of origin (p < .001), religion (p < .001), education centre (p < .001) and refugee status (p = .018). CONCLUSION: With knowledge from this study, mental health professionals can initiate or improve liaison with religious-based services in working together to provide resources for adolescent refugees. Incorporating information regarding mental health with religious teachings may help increase resilience in young refugees and, in turn, alleviate their psychological distress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to characterize the profiles of families in the area covered by a Primary Health Center and to identify those in a vulnerable situation. METHOD: this is an epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional and quantitative study. 320 home visits were made, defined by a random sample of the areas covered by the Urban Center 1 in the city of Sao Sebastiao, in Brazil's Federal District. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection, elaborated based on the Family Development Index (FDI). RESULTS: there was a predominance of young families, women, and low levels of schooling. The FDI permitted the identification of families in situations of "high" and "very high" vulnerability. The most critical dimensions were: "access to knowledge" and "access to work". CONCLUSION: the study indicated the importance of greater investments in the areas of education, work and income, and highlighted the need for the use of a wider concept of vulnerability by the health services.

AB  - This editorial provides an overview of the efforts to enhance resiliency in the community. Resiliency can be thought of as the ability to withstand bad things happening without the expected devastating outcomes. Advocates of resiliency typically attempt, through internal changes of the individual or the strengthening of some environmental support, to allow the person to withstand some negative force and manage to "beat the odds" of negative outcomes. Withstanding hardship and beating the odds of falling victim to difficult situations are noble as well as romantic aspirations-they have, in fact, a certain quixoticism associated with them. Those in the helping professions who work with poor populations of color have, for some time now, advocated, studied, and talked about resiliency. The limited success at significantly improving the lives of minorities and poor people while using this focus suggests that one needs to sustain a balanced perspective and should continue to look for strengths and protective factors, but we must be more willing to acknowledge the problems that the poor and minority populations are experiencing as a result of structural forces that are completely overpowering their personal strengths, their cultural strengths, or both. Those in the helping professions are better at influencing the attitudes and behaviors of those needing help than those who are at influencing the larger political, economic, and racial biases commonly at the root of many of their difficulties.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe inequalities in perinatal and maternal mortality, and morbidity from an international high-income country perspective. Measures of inequalities are socioeconomic status, ethnic background, and living area. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite decreasing overall perinatal and maternal mortality in high-income countries, perinatal and maternal health inequalities persist. Inequalities in fetal, neonatal, and maternal adverse outcome relate to specific groups of risk factors. They commonly have a background in so-called structural risk factors, that is low level of education and income, being a migrant and living in disadvantaged areas. Structural risk factors therefore drive inequalities, and simultaneously represent the common perspective to judge perinatal and maternal health gaps. The effect of risk factors is further magnified in urban areas through risk accumulation.As mother and child share their background, neonatal, and maternal adverse health outcome patterns coincide, resulting in similar inequalities and similar epidemiological trends. The structural background explains the difficulty of improving this. SUMMARY: Inequalities in perinatal and maternal outcome persist in women from lower socioeconomic groups, from specific ethnic groups, and from those living in deprived areas. In view of the lifelong consequences, these marked social disparities pose an important challenge for the political decision makers and the healthcare system.

AB  - Population aging forces governments to change their policy on elderly care. Older people, even if they are frail and disabled, are motivated to stay in their own homes and environment for as long as possible. Consequently, the early detection of frail older persons is appropriate to avoid adverse outcomes. Several instruments to detect frailty exist, but none use environmental indicators. This study addresses the development and psychometric properties of the Comprehensive Frailty Assessment Instrument (CFAI). This new self-reporting instrument includes physical, psychological, social and environmental domains. The CFAI showed good fit indices and a high reliability. The underlying structure of the CFAI demonstrates the multidisciplinary nature of frailty. Using the CFAI can stimulate nurses and other community healthcare providers toward a more holistic approach of frailty and can guide them to take appropriate interventions to prevent adverse outcomes such as disabilities or hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of risk assessment has focused on protecting the health of individual people or populations of wildlife from single risks, mostly from chemical exposure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began to address multiple risks to communities in the "Framework for Cumulative Risk Assessment" [EPA/630/P02/001F. Washington DC:Risk Assessment Forum, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2003)]. Simultaneously, several reports concluded that some individuals and groups are more vulnerable to environmental risks than the general population. However, vulnerability has received little specific attention in the risk assessment literature. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to examine the issue of vulnerability in cumulative risk assessment and present a conceptual framework rather than a comprehensive review of the literature. In this article we consider similarities between ecologic and human communities and the factors that make communities vulnerable to environmental risks. DISCUSSION: The literature provides substantial evidence on single environmental factors and simple conditions that increase vulnerability or reduce resilience for humans and ecologic systems. This observation is especially true for individual people and populations of wildlife. Little research directly addresses the topic of vulnerability in cumulative risk situations, especially at the community level. The community level of organization has not been adequately considered as an end point in either human or ecologic risk assessment. Furthermore, current information on human risk does not completely explain the level of response in cumulative risk conditions. Ecologic risk situations are similarly more complex and unpredictable for cases of cumulative risk. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial conditions and responses are the principal missing element for humans. We propose a model for including psychologic and social factors as an integral component of cumulative risk assessment.

AB  - To address the burden of maternal morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), research with pregnant women in these settings is increasingly common. Pregnant women in LMIC-context may experience vulnerability related to giving consent to participate in a clinical trial. To recognize possible layers of vulnerability this study aims to identify factors that influence the decision process towards clinical trial participation of pregnant women in an urban middle-income setting. This qualitative research used participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussion with medical staff and pregnant women eligible for trial participation, at a regional hospital in Accra, Ghana. Besides lack of familiarity with modern scientific concepts, specific factors influencing the decision-making process were identified. These include a wide power difference between health provider and patient, and a different perception of risk through externalization of responsibility of risk management within a religious context as well as a context shaped by authority. Also, therapeutic misconception was observed. The combination of these factors ensued women to rely on the opinion of the medical professional, rather than being guided by their own motivation to participation. Although being a (pregnant) woman per se should not render the label of being vulnerable, this study shows there are factors that influence the decision process of pregnant woman towards trial participation in a LMIC context that can result in vulnerability. The identification of context-specific factors that can create vulnerability facilitates adaptation of the design and conduct of research in a culturally competent manner.

AB  - Immigrants have been identified as a vulnerable population, but there is heterogeneity in the degree to which they are vulnerable to inadequate health care. Here we examine the factors that affect immigrants' vulnerability, including socioeconomic background; immigration status; limited English proficiency; federal, state, and local policies on access to publicly funded health care; residential location; and stigma and marginalization. We find that, overall, immigrants have lower rates of health insurance, use less health care, and receive lower quality of care than U.S.-born populations; however, there are differences among subgroups. We conclude with policy options for addressing immigrants' vulnerabilities.

AB  - When, in 2010, a new PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) strategy replaced the provision of infant formula to mothers living with HIV by a prophylaxis based on antiretrovirals, some Senegalese couples decided to purchase infant formula on their own, thereby risking 'medically induced poverty'. This case study analyzes the emergence of a situation of economic vulnerability generated by a public health policy that is nevertheless globally appropriate in terms of accessibility and epidemiological effectiveness. Because of the gap between the rationales of institutions at the international and national levels and those of people 'on the ground', a strategy that has been defined as progress in terms of equity is interpreted as a regression creating inequality. This situation stems from several determinants analyzed in this article: rapid and poorly managed transition from one strategy to another, different perceptions of acceptable risk levels, and inadequate communication of information by care providers.

AB  - When, in 2010, a new PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) strategy replaced the provision of infant formula to mothers living with HIV by a prophylaxis based on antiretrovirals, some Senegalese couples decided to purchase infant formula on their own, thereby risking 'medically induced poverty'. This case study analyzes the emergence of a situation of economic vulnerability generated by a public health policy that is nevertheless globally appropriate in terms of accessibility and epidemiological effectiveness. Because of the gap between the rationales of institutions at the international and national levels and those of people 'on the ground', a strategy that has been defined as progress in terms of equity is interpreted as a regression creating inequality. This situation stems from several determinants analyzed in this article: rapid and poorly managed transition from one strategy to another, different perceptions of acceptable risk levels, and inadequate communication of information by care providers.

AB  - This study examines the association between a household's degree of vulnerability to food crisis and the incidence of deaths using primary survey data carried out to look at the demographic consequences of drought and famine in the drought-prone areas of northern Ethiopia. Retrospective data on the occurrences of deaths within a household were collected for the period 1984 to 1994. Consistent with previous studies, the findings confirm that mortality was clustered among the age groups 1-4 and 5-9 and varied considerably by famine and non-famine years. Enormous variation in incidence of deaths was also observed by region, ethnicity and religion. Most importantly, the analysis provides substantial evidence that the level of household vulnerability to food crisis is strongly related to the number of hunger-related deaths reported in a household.

AB  - Empirical research has shown that households in developing countries are unable to sustain current levels of consumption during and after severe health crises due to substantial increase in medical expenditure and/or loss of income. Health events are also found to have an adverse impact on nutritional status and educational attainment of household members. Thus, in this study, we investigate: who are vulnerable to welfare loss from health shocks, what are the household responses to cope with the economic burden of health shocks and if policy responses like state health insurance schemes are effective in reducing the economic vulnerability. We use self-reported measures of health shocks and coping strategies from the longitudinal survey of the ongoing Young Lives project in India [Andhra Pradesh (AP)] to identify the characteristics of vulnerable groups and perform three-level random intercept logistic regression that takes into account contextual or environmental factors. What emerges is socioeconomic status of household (determined by education, wealth, occupation and caste/religious group) and its demographic characteristics like gender of the household head and proportion of elderly and disabled members matter for outcomes related to health events. Households adopt different strategies to cope with the economic costs of ill-health; borrowing is the most widely used strategy. For credit, majority of households rely on informal sources (moneylenders, friends, relatives, etc.) and have little or no access to formal sources. However, health shock to main breadwinner leads to households adopting costly strategies like reducing consumption or sending children to work. We found no evidence that the state health insurance scheme reduced the household welfare loss from health shocks and their coping strategies. The results suggest that health insurance schemes have to be complemented with access to micro-credit and social security schemes for self-employed persons/workers in informal sector to reduce the economic burden faced by households due to health shocks.

AB  - The evaluation of thiamine and its derivative phosphate esters levels in pregnant women in rural communities can contribute not only for understanding the specific characteristics of this population regarding nutritional aspects, but also for clarifying the relations of psychiatric manifestations and a vitamin deficit. In the present work we assessed sociodemographic variables, psychiatric parameters and thiamine and its derivative in the whole blood of women in a rural, low-income community in Brazil. A case-control study was done. 94 women were divided in groups using the trimesters of pregnancy as a criterion: each trimester, 1st, 2nd and 3rd had 17, 37 and 38 women, respectively. A control group of non-pregnant women (n-39) was also included. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the HAMA Scale and Beck Inventory, respectively. The thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives concentrations were determined in whole blood samples using the HPLC method. The results suggest that physiological mechanisms linked to the metabolic pathways of thiamine may play a role in some neurobiological substrate involved in the regulation of emotional state. Thus, social vulnerability is identified as an important factor to be considered in the evaluation of the mental health of pregnant women living in rural communities.

AB  - The Water-associated Disease Index (WADI) was developed to identify and visualize vulnerability to different water-associated diseases by integrating a range of social and biophysical determinants in map format. In this study vulnerability is used to encompass conditions of exposure, susceptibility, and differential coping capacity to a water-associated health hazard. By assessing these conditions, the tool is designed to provide stakeholders with an integrated and long-term understanding of subnational vulnerabilities to water-associated disease and contribute to intervention strategies to reduce the burden of illness. The objective of this paper is to describe and validate the WADI tool by applying it to dengue. A systemic ecohealth framework that considers links between people, the environment and health was applied to identify secondary datasets, populating the index with components including climate conditions, land cover, education status and water use practices. Data were aggregated to create composite indicators of exposure and of susceptibility in a Geographic Information System (GIS). These indicators were weighted by their contribution to dengue vulnerability, and the output consisted of an overall index visualized in map format. The WADI was validated in this Malaysia case study, demonstrating a significant association with dengue rates at a sub-national level, and illustrating a range of factors that drive vulnerability to the disease within the country. The index output indicated high vulnerability to dengue in urban areas, especially in the capital Kuala Lumpur and surrounding region. However, in other regions, vulnerability to dengue varied throughout the year due to the influence of seasonal climate conditions, such as monsoon patterns. The WADI tool complements early warning models for water-associated disease by providing upstream information for planning prevention and control approaches, which increasingly require a comprehensive and geographically broad understanding of vulnerability for implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although four decades have passed since the concept of 'vulnerable children' has been introduced into paediatric literature, research on vulnerability is limited to high-income, Western countries. To adapt and adopt practices that have been advised for paediatricians to prevent 'the vulnerable child syndrome', information is needed also on the prevalence and correlates of perceived vulnerability in children in low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate and correlates of the perception of vulnerability among healthy young children in a healthy population of children in Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, participants comprised of a 'prescriptive sample' of healthy, thriving children with no known health risk for vulnerability. Maternal perception of child vulnerability was assessed using the Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS). Potential risks factors for vulnerability including history of threatened abortion during pregnancy, child gender, birth order, maternal and paternal age and education were collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 519 children - 264 boys (50.9%) and 255 girls (49.1%) - comprised the sample. The internal consistency of the CVS was 0.71. Item-total scale correlations were 0.30 or above for all of the eight items. The median CVS score of the sample was 2.0 and 30 mothers (5.8%) were found to perceive their children as vulnerable. None of the socio-demographic variables that were investigated were found to be associated with high vulnerability scores. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to examine maternal perceived vulnerability of healthy children in a middle-income country. The findings imply that a high proportion of healthy children are perceived as vulnerable by their mothers and that previously studied socio-demographic factors do not explain perceived vulnerability. The results of this study may provide a comparison point for studies on childhood vulnerability in LAMI countries.

AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of an analysis of the concept of vulnerability in homeless adolescents. BACKGROUND: Caring for vulnerable populations and reduction of health inequities are top international healthcare priorities. Homeless adolescents experience health disparities as compared to their housed counterparts and are among the most vulnerable of all populations. Understanding the concept of vulnerability as it relates to the homeless adolescent population will assist nurses in addressing the health and social concerns of this population. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Medline, Cochrane and CINAHL electronic databases were used to search for research papers published between 1980 and 2009. The keywords 'vulnerable', 'vulnerability' and 'homeless', 'adolescent', 'street' and 'youth' were used. Twenty-three papers from multiple disciplines were reviewed in an effort to arrive at a global definition of homeless adolescents' vulnerability. METHOD: Rodgers' evolutionary method of concept analysis was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Based on this analysis, vulnerability in homeless adolescents is defined as the constellation of past, present and future risk, perceived or real, because of the common human experience of risk, the increased vulnerability of the adolescent period, the consequences of family disruption, and the increased risks of life on the street. CONCLUSION: There was agreement in the literature regarding the antecedents, attributes, consequences and surrogate terms of the concept. However, differentiation between the concepts of risk and vulnerability, as suggested by seminal nurse researchers, was not supported. More research is needed into self-perceptions of vulnerability and vulnerability in subgroups of homeless adolescents.

AB  - The article outlines the development and initial validation of a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) including five social determinants of risk to health and demonstrates its application in the financing of primary care by the Unified Health System (SUS) in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. Municipal indicators of vulnerability relating to poverty and population dispersion were obtained from the 2010 population census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis suggests that the five items can constitute a reliable and acceptable measurement scale. The SVI-5 was then generated based on the first main component, measuring municipal inequalities in social vulnerability relating to poverty and population in the territory in Z-scores. The external validity of SVI-5 was examined in relation to health outcomes using DATASUS 2007-2011 data, revealing that infant mortality and hospitalizations for conditions treatable by primary care are greater in more vulnerable municipalities The results suggest that the SVI-5 is a valid measure of inequalities in social vulnerability between municipalities, applicable to socially equitable policies in health.

AB  - AIM: To raise questions about how the United States of America, which spends 1.3 trillion dollars on health care, conducts cutting-edge biomedical research, has the most advanced medical technology, and trains a cadre of highly competent health professionals cares for the most vulnerable members of its population. METHODS: Relevant statistical data were extrapolated from the most current statistical sources and research reports, and assessed in terms of existing practices and policies. RESULTS: The data clearly demonstrated that particular population cohorts -- the elderly, the poor, new immigrants, the homeless, the HIV-positive, and substance abusers -- were especially vulnerable to illness and its consequences. CONCLUSION: Since American medicine, despite all of its science, technology, and clinical competence, operates in a non-system, there is currently no efficacious approach to vulnerability reduction. To turn health care in the U.S. into a high quality, comprehensive, and cost-effective system, government officials, health care planners, and medical practitioners must address a series of fundamental social, economic, and political issues. What other countries, like those in South Eastern Europe, can learn from this is not to duplicate these mistakes.

AB  - Many of the challenges facing children now are a function of changing times, including increase in urbanization, political violence, changing family forms, and in some areas decreased supplies of adequate food. This review focuses particularly on those changes in which children are the victims and which induce new threats for them, rather than on problems such as child disability or mental illness. The outcome variables of interest in this paper are dimensions of children's psychosocial development, including cognitive development, psychological adjustment and aggression, whereas the companion paper in this issue (Caldwell P., Child survival: vulnerability and resilience in adversity in the European past and the contemporary Third World, Soc. Sci. Med.) [1] focuses on physical aspects of children's development. The risks that are hurdles in the process of development of a young child begin from conception and carry on into later life. To address them all would be impossible; thus, in order to do justice to the issues at hand, we have chosen those risks that, in our view, are important in a child's psychosocial development in developing countries. This paper will thus provide a discussion of the concepts of risk and resilience, then apply these concepts to the analysis of three examples of risk faced by children today: nutritional threats (e.g. malnutrition due to decline in breastfeeding); family dynamics and types of family forms (e.g. child fostering and non-traditional families); and experiences of violence (domestic or political). In each case, the same four questions will be addressed: what are the consequences of the risk factor for children, what are the etiologies and conditions of risk, are there any children who seem to cope with the risk factor successfully and what are some of the protective factors, and what interventions or programs would help support these children?

AB  - The purpose of this study was to present a spatial analysis of the social vulnerability of teenage pregnancy by geoprocessing data on births and deaths present on the Brazilian Ministry of Health databases in order to support intersectoral management actions and strategies based on spatial analysis in neighborhood areas. The thematic maps of the educational, occupational, birth and marital status of mothers, from all births and deaths in the city, presented a spatial correlation with teenage pregnancy. These maps were superimposed to produce social vulnerability map of adolescent pregnancy and women in general. This process presents itself as a powerful tool for the study of social vulnerability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the growing number of AIDS cases in women reported, community-based interventions, which are essential in this context, are scarce and rarely evaluated. The aim of this study was to carry out a community-based research intervention, to develop and evaluate a set of STD/ AIDS prevention actions targeting the vulnerability of low income women population. METHODS: The study was carried out in Monte Azul slum in the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, in the period 1998-1999. The following actions were put in place: training of health professionals from the local outpatient clinic, availability of prevention resources (male and female condoms), educational groups, educational materials and community radio programs. For evaluating intervention, data from four different research instruments were assessed: pre and post training testing of health professionals, monitoring of condom supply, direct observation of community activities, and record of health professionals and target population's voluntary statements during activities. RESULTS: It was observed an increase in demand for male condom and an interest in female condoms. There were relevant gender and age differences in adhering to proposed activities. Although there were good results regarding sensitization and training of health professionals, their involvement in prevention activities was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies relating to codes, demands and specific interests of the local society, especially those related to gender roles, have successfully performed as preventive actions. Health professionals' overwork at the local outpatient clinic proved to be an important limitation for maintaining preventive actions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A conceptual model for vulnerable populations research relates resource availability and relative risk to health status. The model has a population-based focus that places responsibility for the collective health status of its citizens with the community. Vulnerable populations are social groups who experience limited resources and consequent high relative risk for morbidity and premature mortality. There is considerable research evidence to support the major relationships in the model. Conceptual links that need additional research are identified. CONCLUSIONS: The implications for research include a variety of methodological problems related to recruiting and retaining participants, instrumentation, and data collection. Research designs are needed that move beyond descriptive and epidemiological approaches to interventional and outcome studies. Ethical considerations take on special significance with vulnerable populations.

AB  - Each year, some young people leave children's homes or orphanages in Ghana to start life on their own. However, little is known about their challenges and the factors that influence their coping mechanisms. Data were collected through interviews with 23 care leavers and analysed using the framework analysis. The findings show that the care leavers were experiencing challenges with employment, housing, and social integration. Risk factors included having inadequate social and cultural skills and leaving care without employment. The protective factors that influenced the participants' ability to cope with challenges after leaving care were social support and self-reliance. Recommendations for practice and policy include extending services for young people leaving care, having a national campaign to reduce stigma towards care leavers, and ensuring adequate cultural socialisation for children and young people in residential care facilities.

AB  - This study presents a cross-cultural examination of the psychometric properties of two commonly used brief self-report resilience scales, the 6-item Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and the 4-item Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). Five hundred and eleven Chinese university undergraduate students were recruited for this cross-sectional research. Various psychometric evaluation tools were used to evaluate the internal consistency, criterion validity, factorial validity and construct validity of these resilience scales. The results showed that both scales had good criterion validity, with well-established measures of well-being, optimism, self-esteem, self-efficacy and mental health, as suggested in the resilience literature. The BRS (a = 0.71) showed better internal consistency than the BRCS (a = 0.59). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results also indicated that the BRS, with a two-factor structure, had better construct validity than the BRCS. The CFA results for the BRS met all of the criteria for a good model fit. The BRS was found to have better psychometric properties than the BRCS in the Chinese context. The findings will help researchers to select an appropriate resilience measure when conducting epistemological surveys of Chinese university students or the Chinese diaspora in other contexts.

AB  - After discussing advantages and risks, only a third of the 290 HIV-infected women included in an intervention study to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Mombasa, Kenya, informed their partners of their results. Despite careful counselling, 10% subsequently experienced violence or disruption of their relationship. To increase the uptake of interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission safely, we recommend the involvement of partners in HIV testing. In addition, the counselling of women has to address methods and skills to deal with violence.

AB  - Despite the recognition that people with disability are among the poorest and most marginalized, breaking the disability-poverty cycle has proven challenging. Although UN agencies, most donors, and nongovernmental organizations have disability and development policies, many programs perpetuate disability-based discrimination. Little research examines why such programs fail to achieve sustained livelihood improvement for people with disability. Findings from this study that explored the experience of disability in Cambodia suggest that programs must explicitly address social and cultural norms and power relations. Recommendations for inclusive practice are presented. Listening to the voices of people with disability is the crucial first step.

AB  - Disasters seem destined to be major issues of academic enquiry in the new century if for no other reason than that they are inseparably linked to questions of environmental conservation, resource depletion and migration patterns in an increasingly globalised world. Unfortunately, inadequate attention has been directed at considering the historical roots of the discursive framework within which hazard is generally presented, and how that might reflect particular cultural values to do with the way in which certain regions or zones of the world are usually imagined. This paper argues that tropicality, development and vulnerability form part of one and the same essentialising and generalising cultural discourse that denigrates large regions of world as disease-ridden, poverty-stricken and disaster-prone.

AB  - This work describes assessment of the psychometric properties of a self-report instrument, the Glover Vulnerability Scale. This scale was administered to a total of 11 groups (N = 695). Six of the groups were Vietnam combat veterans diagnosed as having Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (n = 531). The estimate of internal consistency was .88; the test-retest correlation over 4 wk. was .81. Convergent and discriminant validations were satisfactory based on the pattern of the scale's correlations with relevant MMPI subscales and demographic data. Scale scores also discriminated levels of functioning within the population diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and discriminated veterans diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder from patients with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. Principal component factor analysis gave a 4-factor solution: social comfort, vulnerability, paranoia, and family trust. Over-all, the findings strongly support the clinical application of the Vulnerability Scale.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are many different conceptual definitions of frailty in circulation. Most of these definitions focus mainly on physical problems affecting older people. Only a few also draw attention to other domains of human functioning such as the psychological domain. The authors of this article fear that this could lead to fragmentation of care for frail older people. The aim is to develop an integral conceptual definition of frailty that starts from the premise of a holistic view of the person. METHODS: To achieve this, a literature search was carried out. Thereafter a group of experts (N=20) were consulted, both verbally during 2 expert meetings and via a written questionnaire. These experts were asked which existing conceptual definition of frailty places most stress on the integral functioning of older people. RESULTS: The experts expressed a clear preference for one of the conceptual definitions. The result of the literature search and the consultation with the experts led to a new integral conceptual definition of frailty. CONCLUSION: The conceptual definition is intended to offer a framework for an operational definition of frailty for identifying frail older people.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Most conceptual and operational definitions of frailty place heavy emphasis on the physical problems encountered by older people. The accompanying models are based largely on a medical model. An integral approach is almost never adopted. This study aims to develop both an integral operational definition of frailty and an integral conceptual model of frailty. DESIGN: In order to achieve these aims, a thorough literature search was performed on components of operational definitions and models of frailty. In addition, experts (N=17) were consulted during two expert meetings. RESULTS: There was consensus among the experts on the inclusion of the following components in the operational definition of frailty: strength, balance, nutrition, endurance, mobility, physical activity and cognition. Some respondents indicated that they would wish to add components from the psychological or social domain. Supported by results from the literature search, a new integral operational definition of frailty was developed. This operational definition lies at the heart of an integral conceptual working model of frailty. This model expresses the relationships between three domains of frailty, adverse outcomes such as disability and the determinants. CONCLUSION: The model should be able to serve as a basis for further scientific research on frailty. The model also provides a framework for the development of a measurement instrument which can be used for the identification of frail elderly persons.

AB  - The health status of a population is the conjunction of many biological, political and social factors. The biological representations of diseases are attributed to factors, such as ischemic heart disease, that are attributed to unhealthy lifestyles when individuals have high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, or lack of physical activity, or to genetic factors while ignoring social factors such as poverty. This study observes how morbidity and mortality of the population could be affected by living conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to share the results of a scoping review that examined the relationship between health care disparities and the multiplicity of vulnerability factors that are often clustered together. METHODS: The conceptual framework used was an innovative dynamic model that we developed to analyze the co-existence of multiple vulnerability factors (multi-vulnerability) related to the phenomenon of the 'Inverse Care Law'. A total of 759 candidate references were identified through a literature search, of which 23 publications were deemed relevant to our scoping review. RESULTS: The review confirmed our hypothesis of a direct correlation between co-existing vulnerability factors and health care disparities. Several gaps in the literature were identified, such as a lack of research on vulnerable populations' perception of their own vulnerability and on multimorbidity and immigrant status as aspects of vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: Future research addressing the revealed gaps would help foster primary care interventions that are responsive to the needs of vulnerable people and, eventually, contribute to the reduction of health care disparities in society.

AB  - The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) is a regional trade agreement currently being negotiated by 11 Pacific Rim countries, excluding China. While the negotiations are being conducted under a veil of secrecy, substantive leaks over the past 4 years have revealed a broad view of the proposed contents. As it stands the TPPA poses serious risks to global public health, particularly chronic, non-communicable diseases. At greatest risk are national tobacco regulations, regulations governing the emergence of generic drugs and controls over food imports by transnational corporations. Aside from a small group of public health professionals from Australia, the academic public health community has missed these threats to the global community, although many other health-related entities, international lawyers and health-conscious politicians have voiced serious concerns. As of mid-2014 there has been no comment in the leading public health journals. This large lacuna in interest or recognition reflects the larger problem that the public health education community has all but ignored global non-communicable diseases. Without such a focus, the risks are unseen and the threats not perceived. This cautionary tale of the TPPA reflects the vulnerability of being ill informed of contemporary realities.

AB  - PURPOSE: In situations of adversity, young people draw on individual, relational, and contextual (community and cultural) resources to foster their resilience. Recent literature defines resilience as a capacity that is underpinned by a network of interrelated resources. Although empirical studies show evidence of the value of a network approach, little is known regarding how different country contexts influence which resources are most critical within a resource network and how resources interact for adolescent resilience. METHODS: Network analysis was conducted with data from studies that had used the Child and Youth Resilience Measure. Regularized partial correlation networks of 17 resources were estimated for 14 countries (Botswana, Canada, China, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Romania, South Africa, and Syrian refugees living in Jordan). The sample size was 18,914 (mean age = 15.70 years, 48.8% female). RESULTS: We observed mostly positive associations between the resources of interest. The salience and strength of associations between resources varied by country. The most central resource across countries was having supportive caregivers during stressful times because this resource had the most and strongest positive associations with other resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives first empirical evidence from multiple countries that an interplay of social-ecological resources (such as individual skills, peer, caregiver and community support, and educational aspirations and opportunities) matter for adolescent resilience. Across countries, caregiver support appears to be most central for adolescent resilience. Future resilience interventions might apply this network approach to identify important, contextually relevant resources that likely foster additional resources.

AB  - Based on fieldwork material from Lao People's Democratic Republic, this paper introduces an analytical framework that transcends compartmentalized approaches towards migration involving young people. The notions of fluid and institutionalized forms of migration illuminate key differences and commonalities in the relational fabric underpinning empirically diverse migration scenarios. Applying this framework to the role of networks in becoming a young migrant, this chapter sheds light on young migrants' differential scope for exercising agency. This redirects concerns about young migrants away from descriptive and static factors towards their relational position in the process of migration, which shapes their agency and vulnerability.

AB  - American Indians are disproportionately affected by factors that lead to health disparities, however many Native people demonstrate resilience when faced with health risks. Study objectives were to use a resilience framework to identify wellness strategies among American Indian people and to assess health care provider perceptions of American Indian wellness. Participants included 39 American Indian adults who self-reported resilient change and 22 health care providers who served American Indian patients. Thematic categories across American Indian and health care provider data were identified: 1) relationships inform resilience; 2) prejudice stymies resilience; and 3) place shapes resilience. Results indicated the salience of relationships in demonstrating resilience. Identified challenges and supporters of resilience are discussed.

AB  - In developing countries, educating all levels of the society for disaster threats is not always possible due lack of expertise and educational materials. Consequently, one of the best ways of publicising awareness programmes can be the integration of thest initiatives into children's activities. Since over half of the population in many developing countries is under 18 years of age, it is possible to convey vital information to most of the population via the knowledge, skills and enthusiastic motivation of children. They are able to disseminate messages throughout their societies, starting with their parents. Fortunately, the level of acceptance in parents from their children is generally high in these countries. The first objective of this paper is to look at awareness-raising as a core to all disaster mitigation programmes. The paper then focuses on earthquake education through children. The study will also illustrate this process through a lection of examples of educational campaigns in different developing countries resulting in successful public awareness-raising for children. These programmes strengthen resilience among communities by enabling them to withstand shocks, cope with emergencies when they occur and bounce back from disaster impact.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sexually experienced, unmarried adolescent women, usually commence sex, with marriage in mind. Initially, they resist sex but are unsuccessful due to lack of resilience to end an oppressive relationship, or convince their partners to postpone sex or use protection. To retain partners, they accept unprotected sex and suffer its consequences such as unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer. Considerable numbers of adolescents face this emotional stress and suffer the consequences, while some manage to endure and emerge from the ordeal. This study attempts to determine this resilience and extrapolate it to others who might not be so successful without an intervention. METHODOLOGY: The study compares sexual resilience in 100 unmarried adolescent abortion-seekers, in terms of time taken from meeting the partner, to sexual debut and correlates this with background factors such as age, education, family income, self-esteem, sexual knowledge, attitude toward pre-marital sex (PMS) and partner pressure. RESULTS: Mean debut age was 17.32 years. Partners took more initiative to form emotional (64%) and physical relationship (78%). Adolescent girls' initiative reduced markedly from emotional (22%) to physical relation (5%). Correlation of sexual resilience with age, family income education and knowledge was not significant. It was significantly correlated with attitude toward PMS, self-esteem and partner pressure. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: It is desirable to improve self-esteem and attitude of young women to build negotiation skills in intimate relations. Counselors have to reorient the perspectives to improve attitude toward abstinence and increase self-esteem to resist pressure from partners.

AB  - Background: In developing countries such as India, inadequate importance and consideration given to assessment of health care facilities negatively affects progress towards achieving health targets. India has focused on developing Primary Health Centres (PHCs) for rural basic laboratory and curative services. The local decision-makers do not have any national-level framework to evaluate the vulnerability of PHCs which are not meeting national PHC standards, nor do they have resources to meet national PHC standards. Aim(s): The study proposed a framework to assess the public health care facilities for vulnerability. Method(s): A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed. The study used PHC laboratory services of 42 PHCs of Osmanabad District, India as a case study for proposed framework. The data assessment was carried out at district level, block level, PHC cluster level, and PHC level to provide flexibility to local decision-makers in taking remedial measures. Result(s): Staff workload (73.17%), physician's need (51.22%), and organization structure (36.59%) are the most prevalent challenges across PHCs. Multiple challenges are prevalent in the PHCs across districts. The PHCs with poor medical doctor (MD) capability or many challenges have shown poor laboratory performance. Conclusion(s): Governance need to be strengthened in PHCs, followed by sustained support in resources and financing. Poor health status in developing nations necessitates a public health response based on health systems. Therefore, an assessment of health facility vulnerability in the form of laboratory services is essential in primary health care facilities.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the intra-urban differentials related to the outcome of the Newborn Hearing Screening (NHS) of children living in Belo Horizonte tested in a reference service using the Health Vulnerability Index (HVI). METHODS: cross-sectional study with children living in Belo Horizonte evaluated by a Newborn Hearing Screening Reference Service (NHSRS) between 2010 and 2011. The HVI of the census tract of each child was obtained by the georeferencing of their respective addresses. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the decision tree technique, considering a statistical model for each response. A thematic map of points representing the geographic distribution of the children evaluated by the NHS program was also developed. RESULTS: The NHS failure rate for children living in areas with very high HVI, or without HVI data, was 1.5 times higher than that for children living in other census tracts. For children living in areas of low, medium, and high HVI, who underwent NHS after 30 days of life, the NHS failure rate was 2.1 times higher in children that presented Risk Indicator for Hearing Loss (RIHL) (17.2%) than in those who did not (8.1%). Uneven distribution was observed between areas for children that underwent the NHS and those who failed it. CONCLUSION: Significant intra-urban differentials were found in Belo Horizonte, indicating correlation between health vulnerability and NHS outcomes.

AB  - Our aim in this article is to explore what is known about resilience in women and girls; to theorise how gender-roles are reflected in women's and girls' resilience processes; and to explore how apposite researchers' explanations of resilience are for black South African girls. We1 conducted a systematic review entailing a qualitative synthesis using relevant qualitative studies focusing on resilience in girls and women of all ages and from diverse cultural groups. Findings from studies that report predominantly on the experiences of Western women suggest that women's and girls' resilience-supporting mechanisms (agency and strength-fostering spirituality) are cultivated through constructive relational contexts that offer emotional and pragmatic support. Gender-roles of interdependence, the physical and emotional caretaking of others, and emotional expressiveness manifest in resilience-supporting mechanisms through complex person-context interactions. However, if the context- and culturally-specific nature of resilience is taken into account, explanations of resilience in black South African girls are limited, and further robust research on the subject is needed.

AB  - Resilience, as an ability to withstand and rebound from crisis and adversity, is becoming an increasingly popular concept in research on intervention and prevention of mental health. The present study examined psychometric properties of a Persian version of the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), a scale intended to measure protective factors presumed to enhance resilience. The participants were 373 university undergraduate students, as well as 30 pairs of run-away girls and a matched control group. A confirmatory factor analysis verified the Norwegian five-factor structure. All subscale scores, personal competence, social competence, family cohesion, social resources and structured style, had good reliability. The convergent validity of the RSA was supported by showing positive associations with another resilience scale, i.e., a Persian version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Predictive validity of the RSA was supported, as well, by significantly differentiating between girls who had run away from home and a matched control group. The results indicate that the RSA may be a valid and reliable scale for the assessment of resilience protective resources in an Iranian population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain an understanding of how obstetric complications affect the lives and livelihoods of survivors. METHODS: A phenomenological study was conducted between April and August 2013 at Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Data were collected through in-depth interviews among 36 women admitted with obstetric near miss. The interviews investigated perceptions, lived experiences, and meanings attached to such experiences by survivors. More specifically, the questions explored: self-rated health; anticipated social, sexual, and reproductive health challenges; and mitigating factors. RESULTS: The identified themes were prior expectations, vulnerability, body and social capital, and resilience. Women were found to approach childbirth with predetermined expectations that influenced their pregnancy and childbirth experience. Fatalism, expectations, and social insecurity markedly contributed to vulnerability. Resilience factors included ability to institute adaptations and to harness body and social capital. CONCLUSION: Vulnerabilities and their determinants were found to be inter-related. Individuals' social capital fluctuates over the acute crisis, necessitating multiple adaptations and coping strategies to reduce vulnerability or increase resilience. Although social and body capital may be mobilized to mitigate the effects of the obstetric crisis, they can either worsen vulnerability or increase resilience.

AB  - Accounts are increasing of non-voluntary deportations of Kosovar adolescents from European countries to Kosovo, and human rights organizations have condemned deportation practices endorsed by European governments for being violent and detrimental to adolescents' physical and psychosocial health and well-being. However, research remains scarce on the connections among migration, repatriation and reintegration realities, and adolescents' experiences of psychosocial health and well-being. This article describes how adolescent returnees living in Kosovo express their emotional distress, their struggle with negative living conditions, and their exposure to violence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 adolescents with very high-level post-traumatic stress and depression symptomatology and a General Health Questionnaire score of 40 or higher. This empirical data provided in-depth information about the adolescents' narratives of symptoms and illness, explanations of symptom and illness causation, ongoing stressors and the impacts these factors have on their health and well-being. The study found that suffering and related health problems are associated with a sense of loss and ongoing social isolation, economic problems, precarious living conditions, and discrimination. The adolescents' lack of social and economic capital makes accessing appropriate resources and professional help for their health and social problems extremely difficult. In the discussion and conclusion section, recommendations are made for the development of appropriate and holistic psychosocial interventions focusing on well-being and human rights.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent life events may be significant risk factors for depression during pregnancy. However, its association with the individual's resilience and social support is not clear. AIMS: To understand the association between life events and depression during pregnancy and whether the association is moderated by resilience and social support. METHODS: This study is part of a prospective cohort study on perinatal mental health in an urban antenatal clinic, which included 589 women recruited in the first and early second trimester. Participants were administered the Life Events Checklist adapted from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale by the authors to assess life events; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 to assess depression and resilience, respectively. The relationship between life events (12 months prior to the time of assessment) and antenatal depression and the moderating role of resilience and social support was analysed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight women (6.5%) who had depression (EPDS score 11) had significantly higher number of life events (i.e. on average three; U = 3,826; p < .01), lower resilience scores ( U = 4,053; p < .01) and lower perceived social support ( U = 2,423; p < .01) as compared to those who were negative for depression on EPDS. Life events predicted depression during pregnancy; however, the relationship was moderated by social support but not by resilience. CONCLUSION: The pregnant women who experienced life events may experience depression during the first trimester of pregnancy, but the effect could possibly be reduced by enhancing the social support.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vulnerability is a poorly understood concept in research ethics, often aligned to autonomy and consent. A recent addition to the literature represents a taxonomy of vulnerability developed by Kipnis, but this refers to the conduct of clinical trials rather than qualitative research, which may raise different issues. AIM: To examine issues of vulnerability in cancer and palliative care research obtained through qualitative interviews. METHOD: Secondary analysis of qualitative data from 26 black Caribbean and 19 white British patients with advanced cancer. RESULTS: Four domains of vulnerability derived from Kipnis's taxonomy were identified and included: (i) communicative vulnerability, represented by participants impaired in their ability to communicate because of distressing symptoms; (ii) institutional vulnerability, which referred to participants who existed under the authority of others--for example, in hospital; (iii) deferential vulnerability, which included participants who were subject to the informal authority or the independent interests of others; (iv) medical vulnerability, which referred to participants with distressing medical conditions; and (v) social vulnerability, which included participants considered to belong to an undervalued social group. Participants from both ethnic groups populated all these domains, but those who were black Caribbean were more present among the socially vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: Current classifications of vulnerability require reinterpretation when applied to qualitative research at the end of life. We recommend that researchers and research ethics committees reconceptualize vulnerability using the domains identified in this study and consider the research context and interviewers' skills.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because little is known about attitudes toward influenza and influenza vaccine among pregnant women in West Africa, before local distribution of A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in Ivory Coast we assessed knowledge of the pandemic and acceptance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in a diverse population of pregnant women. METHODS: A cross-sectional intercept survey of 411 pregnant women in 4 prenatal care settings was conducted during 15-28 February 2010 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. RESULTS: The majority (64.5%) of pregnant women said they had heard of the influenza pandemic, and of these, the majority (61.3%) were aware of the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. However, awareness varied significantly by clinical setting, education level, and access to media (P < .001 for all comparisons). After adjustment for other sociodemographic factors, college-educated women were 16.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-85.2) times as likely as women without formal education to be aware of the pandemic. After controlling for both education and demographic characteristics, women with televisions were 5 times as likely as women without television to be aware of the pandemic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.94; 95% CI, 1.34-18.17). Of those aware of the influenza pandemic, 69.8% said they would accept the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine while they were pregnant. Although awareness was highest in private prenatal care clinics, compared with public outpatient clinics (90.6% vs 37.5%), acceptance of vaccine was significantly lower in private settings, compared with public outpatient settings (57.3% vs 87.2%; P < .001 for each comparison). CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in knowledge about the influenza pandemic and vaccine highlight the challenges of pandemic preparedness in poorer countries, where substantial disparities in education and media access are evident.

AB  - In this article, the Linking Human Systems (LINC) Community Resilience model, a theoretical framework for initiating and sustaining change in communities that have undergone rapid and untimely transition or loss, is presented. The model assumes that individuals, families, and communities are inherently competent and resilient, and that with appropriate support and encouragement, they can access individual and collective strengths that will allow them to transcend their loss. This competence can be nurtured by helping people regain a sense of connectedness with one another; with those who came before them; with their daily patterns, rituals, and stories that impart spiritual meaning; and with tangible resources within their community. Rather than imposing artificial support infrastructures, LINC interventions engage respected community members to act as natural agents for change. These "community links" provide a bridge between outside professionals, families, and communities, particularly in circumstances in which outside intervention may not be welcomed. The article illustrates how LINC interventions successfully have been used in communities around the world.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Timely intrapartum referral between facilities is pivotal in reducing maternal/neonatal mortality and morbidity but is distressing to women, resource-intensive and likely to cause delays in care provision. We explored the complexities around referrals to gain understanding of the characteristics, experiences and outcomes of those being transferred. METHODS: We used a mixed-method parallel convergent design, in Tanzania and Zambia. Quantitative data were collected from a consecutive, retrospective case-note review (target, n = 2000); intrapartum transfers and stillbirths were the outcomes of interest. A grounded theory approach was adopted for the qualitative element; data were collected from semi-structured interviews (n = 85) with women, partners and health providers. Observations (n = 33) of transfer were also conducted. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, followed by binary logistic regression models, with multiple imputation for missing data. Qualitative data were analysed using Strauss's constant comparative approach. RESULTS: Intrapartum transfer rates were 11% (111/998; 2 unknown) in Tanzania and 37% (373/996; 1 unknown) in Zambia. Main reasons for transfer were prolonged/obstructed labour and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. Women most likely to be transferred were from Zambia (as opposed to Tanzania), HIV positive, attended antenatal clinic < 4 times and living > 30 min away from the referral hospital. Differences were observed between countries. Of those transferred, delays in care were common and an increase in poor outcomes was observed. Qualitative findings identified three categories: social threats to successful transfer, barriers to timely intrapartum care and reparative interventions which were linked to a core category: journey of vulnerability. CONCLUSION: Although intrapartum transfers are inevitable, modifiable factors exist with the potential to improve the experience and outcomes for women. Effective transfers rely on adequate resources, effective transport infrastructures, social support and appropriate decision-making. However, women's (and families) vulnerability can be reduced by empathic communication, timely assessment and a positive birth outcome; this can improve women's resilience and influence positive decision-making, for the index and future pregnancy.

AB  - A 'livelihoods gap' has become evident in international aid delivery to Somalia. Existing aid interventions do not address the economic dynamics of vulnerability resulting from Somalia's long history of predatory development and asset stripping. To prevent poor households' regular return to sub-subsistence income levels after a brief period of plenty, this paper argues that aid agencies should reorient and expand existing interventions to assist poor households to capitalise on temporary improvements in environmental and security conditions. As a corollary to emergency relief and efforts to construct state institutions, it is necessary to devise country-wide interventions that will rebuild household asset bases by protecting savings during times of stress and ensuring that markets benefit poor producers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This article describes the application of the vulnerable populations conceptual model to rural health. Vulnerable populations are social groups who have an increased susceptibility to adverse health outcomes. Evidence of this differential in vulnerability or increased risk includes premature mortality, comparative morbidity, decreased functional status, and diminished quality of life. ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK: The vulnerable populations conceptual model postulates that there are interrelationships among resource availability, relative risk, and health status. Resource availability speaks to socioeconomic and environmental resources that are operationalized in this model as income, jobs, education, housing, availability of health care, quality of health care, and patterns of family and community life. Relative risk addresses the likelihood of exposure to risk factors and is reflected in lifestyle behaviors and choices and exposure to stressful events. Health status is operationalized as morbidity and mortality. FINDINGS: This review of the literature supports the utility of the vulnerable populations conceptual model in working with rural populations. IMPLICATIONS: This model has potential utility to inform nursing research, practice, and policy about the opportunities and resources needed to achieve and maintain health in rural communities.

AB  - Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are a promising payment model aimed at reducing costs while also improving the quality of care. However, there is a risk that vulnerable populations may not be fully incorporated into this new model. We define two distinct vulnerable populations, clinically at-risk and socially disadvantaged, and we discuss how ACOs may benefit each group. We provide a framework to use in considering challenges for both vulnerable patients and health systems on the path to accountable care. We identify policies that can help overcome these obstacles: strategies that support ACO formation in diverse settings and that monitor, measure, and reward the performance of providers that reach all patients, including vulnerable populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, and to determine whether resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality among pregnant women. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one pregnant women in their second trimester participated in the study. They completed questionnaires, including: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). A structural equation model was used to analyze the relationships among prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, with resilience as a mediator. RESULTS: Prenatal maternal stress was negatively associated with sleep quality in pregnant women (p < 0.01), whereas resilience was positively associated with sleep quality (p < 0.01). Furthermore, resilience mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality, and the mediation effect ratio was 22.0% (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for disturbed sleep was pregnancy-specific stress; however, the protective factor for sleep quality was resilience. This finding could provide scientific evidence for the development of intervention strategies with which to improve sleep quality in pregnant women.

AB  - Vulnerability of participants in research and the provision of special protections for vulnerable research participants are key concepts in research ethics. Despite international consensus requiring special protections for vulnerable research participants, both the concept of vulnerability and the nature and adequacy of strategies to reduce vulnerability remain vague and, consequently, are subject to varying interpretations. We report on observations of the challenges faced in understanding this key concept by 20 Russian and Romanian trainees participating in a one-year M.A. training program in research ethics from 2000 through 2011. We describe how trainees' understanding of and appreciation for the need for special protections of vulnerable research participants was nurtured. This paper is part of a collection of papers analyzing the Fogarty International Center's International Research Ethics Education and Curriculum Development program.

AB  - Traditional accounts of vulnerability tend to label entire populations as vulnerable. This approach is of limited utility. Instead, this article utilizes a layered approach to vulnerability, identifying multiple vulnerabilities that older people experience. It focuses on distinguishing the different layers of vulnerability that may be experienced by the elderly in middle-income countries of Latin America. In doing so, I show how the layered approach to vulnerability functions, and demonstrate why it is more interesting and useful than the traditional approach. The article achieves three things. First, it unwraps the different potential layers of vulnerability that develop in old age and the multidimensionality aspects of aging. Second, it reestablishes the usefulness of the concept of vulnerability and explains its functioning. Finally, it shows how different policies can be designed in order to address each vulnerability layer. The layered account promotes a multifaceted approach to public policy analyses and design. In this sense, the layered concept of vulnerability is an appealing concept to consider in public health ethics. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal anxiety/depression has been a major public health problem globally with higher prevalence in developing countries, which leads to negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Maternal stress varies over the course of pregnancy and the stress occurring in early pregnancy is the most critical. However, few studies have focused on the impact of resilience to stress on mental health of pregnant women. AIMS: To explore the effect of resilience to stress on prenatal anxiety/depression in pregnant women. METHODS: 2813 participants were recruited from Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) in this study. The Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) was used to assess stress at 12-16 weeks of pregnancy and at 32-36 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Resilience was assessed by the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) at 12-16 weeks of pregnancy. The prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed at 32-26 weeks of pregnancy by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the direct effect of stress and resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression. The indirect effects of mediation were analyzed by structural equation models, and the indirect effect of modification was examined by stratification analysis. RESULTS: There were 11.1% and 10.3% of pregnant women in Shanghai MCPC indicating anxiety and depressive mood, respectively. The stress caused by both subjective and objective events at 32-36 weeks of pregnancy is less than that at 12-16weeks of pregnancy. We found that resilience was a protective factor for maternal mental health and meanwhile it was both an effect modifier and a mediator to the association between stress and prenatal anxiety/depression, with the mediating effect ratio of 15.1% and 23.8%, respectively. LIMITATIONS: The existence of recall bias, missing data, and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the generalizability of the study. The measurements of resilience, prenatal anxiety, and depression were not designed specifically for pregnant women, so that they might have missed some important indications of mental issues related to pregnant women only. CONCLUSIONS: Resilience could be a direct and indirect protective factor for prenatal anxiety and depression caused by pregnancy stress.

AB  - While many health services strive to be equitable, accessible and inclusive, peoples' right to health often goes unrealized, particularly among vulnerable groups. The extent to which health policies explicitly seek to achieve such goals sets the policy context in which services are delivered and evaluated. An analytical framework was developed--EquiFrame--to evaluate 1) the extent to which 21 Core Concepts of human rights were addressed in policy documents, and 2) coverage of 12 Vulnerable Groups who might benefit from such policies. Using this framework, analysis of 51 policies across Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Sudan, confirmed the relevance of all Core Concepts and Vulnerable Groups. Further, our analysis highlighted some very strong policies, serious shortcomings in others as well as country-specific patterns. If social inclusion and human rights do not underpin policy formation, it is unlikely they will be inculcated in service delivery. EquiFrame facilitates policy analysis and benchmarking, and provides a means for evaluating policy revision and development.

AB  - Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction and its surgical treatment remain a controversial topic in spine surgery. Determining success after SIJ fusion may be difficult due to preexisting back pain, lumbar fusion (LF), and functional disability. We examine the utility of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as a measure of clinical outcomes after minimally invasive SIJ fusion. A retrospective review of 24 patients with at least 12- months follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups based on presence of previous LF. Their post-operative ODI was compared with overall satisfaction, pain reduction, and return to work status. No difference in demographics was found in patients with and without prior LF with 92% of patients reporting lower post-operative pain and 96% being satisfied. Presence of LF did not show any statistically significant differences in pain or satisfaction. However, patient with prior LF reported lower ODI than those without LF at 1-year post-operatively (P=0.015). Postoperative ODI may give a falsely pessimistic impression of outcomes in SIJ fusion patients with prior LF, and its use and limitations should be carefully considered in future studies.

This paper first provides a brief history of the specific contexts of violence and resistance that children and youth engage with, and in, on a daily basis in Palestine. It then outlines the efforts of one functioning program in the West Bank, the United Nations Community Mental Health Project, which was designed not only to respond to, but mitigate, child and youth mental health problems in the midst of decades of such political violence.

AB  - In this study we aimed to identify factors that condition (i.e. buffer or exacerbate) the impact of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) on postpartum emotional distress among South African women. Hypothesised buffering factors included: socioeconomic status, family social support, and religiosity. Hypothesised exacerbating factors included: baseline distress, HIV status, and childhood abuse. Longitudinal analyses examined interactions between putative buffering and exacerbating factors and exposure to physical or sexual IPV, assessed during pregnancy (T1), as predictors of emotional distress, measured at 14 weeks (T2) and 9 months postpartum (T3). Consistent with hypotheses, at both T2 and T3 the impact of IPV exposure on emotional distress was significantly stronger among women who reported greater baseline distress and weaker among women of greater socioeconomic status. At T3, an interaction emerged with HIV status; the impact of IPV exposure on emotional distress was stronger for women who were diagnosed as HIV-positive during pregnancy. Findings support the need for targeted mental health promotion interventions for IPV-exposed women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or report high levels of emotional distress during pregnancy. Although more research is needed, findings also suggest that strengthening socioeconomic supports for IPV-exposed women may buffer impacts on postpartum mental health.

AB  - Vulnerability, the susceptibility to harm, results from an interaction between the resources available to individuals and communities and the life challenges they face. Vulnerability results from developmental problems, personal incapacities, disadvantaged social status, inadequacy of interpersonal networks and supports, degraded neighborhoods and environments, and the complex interactions of these factors over the life course. The priority given to varying vulnerabilities, or their neglect, reflects social values. Vulnerability may arise from individual, community, or larger population challenges and requires different types of policy interventions--from social and economic development of neighborhoods and communities, and educational and income policies, to individual medical interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In settings of mass displacement, unaccompanied minors (UAMs) are recognized as a vulnerable group and consequently prioritized by relief efforts. This study examines how the interpretation of vulnerability by the national shelter system for male UAMs in Greece shapes their trajectories into adulthood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between August 2018 and April 2019, key informant interviews were carried out with child protection staff from Greek non-governmental organizations that refer UAMs to specialized children's shelters in Athens to understand how child protection workers interpret vulnerability. In-depth interviews and life history calendars were collected from 44 male migrant youths from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran who arrived in Greece as UAMs but had since transitioned into adulthood. Analysis of in-depth interviews and life history calendars examined how cumulative disadvantage and engagement with the shelter system altered youths' trajectories into adulthood. Younger adolescents were perceived as more vulnerable and prioritized for shelters over those who were "almost 18" years old. However, a subset of youths who requested shelter at the age of 17 years had experienced prolonged journeys where they spent months or years living on their own in socially isolated environments that excluded them from experiences conducive to adolescent development. The shelter system for UAMs in Greece enabled youths to develop new skills and networks that facilitated integration into society, and transferred them into adult housing when they turned 18 years old so that they could continue developing new skills. Those who were not in shelters by age 18 years could not access adult housing and lost this opportunity. Limitations included possible underrepresentation of homeless youth as well as the inability to capture all nationalities of UAMs in Greece, though the 2 most common nationalities, Afghan and Pakistani, were included. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the way vulnerability was interpreted by the shelter system for UAMs, youths who had the greatest need to learn new skills to facilitate their integration often had the least opportunity to do so. To avoid creating long-lasting disparities between UAMs who are placed in shelters and those who are not, pathways should be developed to allow young adult males to enter accommodation facilities and build skills and networks that facilitate integration. Furthermore, cumulative disadvantages should be taken into account while assessing UAMs' vulnerability. Following UAMs' trajectories into early adulthood was critical for capturing this long-term consequence of the shelter system's interpretation of vulnerability.

AB  - Introduction: Adolescents present biological changes and receive social influences which predispose them to pregnancies at early age. Objective(s): To evaluate resilience in a group of pregnant adolescents, to estimate the frequency of low resilience level and identify associated psychosocial factors. Methodology: Cross-sectional study in pregnant adolescents who went to prenatal visit in Cartagena, Colombia. A sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire and validated scales on resilience, familism, religiosity, spirituality, family functionality, partner violence, happiness and self-esteem were applied. Two groups were compared: high/moderate resilience level (HMRL) and low resilience level (LRL). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with LRL. Result(s): 499 pregnant adolescents were studied, average age 17 years, half belonging to dysfunctional families. Sixty four (12,8%) had LRL and were associated factors: low familism OR: 4,736 (IC95%: 2,673-8,392), low self-esteem OR: 4,257 (IC95%: 1,363-13,295), family dysfunction OR: 3,902 (IC95%: 2,052-7,422), partner violence OR:2,689 (IC95%: 1,082-6,678), poor spirituality OR: 2,503 (IC95%: 1,461-4,287) and reduced happiness OR: 2,063 (IC95%: 1,214-3,506). Conclusion(s): In a city of the Colombian Caribbean, in thirteen of every one hundred pregnant adolescents who attend to prenatal visit, LRL was found. Family dysfunction, partner violence in pregnancy, poor spirituality, reduced subjective happiness, low familism and low level of self-esteem, were associated with LRL.Copyright © 2020, Universidad de Antioquia.

AB  - Successful adaptation among immigrant youths is a highly important issue for multiple stakeholders in many countries because of its potential long-term significance for the well-being of migrants and the prosperity and social cohesion of the receiving societies. In this article, I examine immigrant-youth adaptation through the lens of a recently developed resilience model. What are the risks that threaten immigrant youths' adaptation? What are the promotive or protective influences that support their positive adaptation? These questions are addressed using scientific evidence drawn from the Athena Studies of Resilient Adaptation project, a two-cohort, three-wave longitudinal project on immigrant-youth adaptation conducted in Greece, as well as from the international literature. Risks and resources for immigrant youths' concurrent and long-term adaptation are examined in societal, developmental, and acculturative contexts. The integrative model and related scientific findings may inform public policy, as well as guide future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to understand the future expectations and experience of vulnerable mothers from pregnancy to their child's early years. METHODS: this qualitative study used the social phenomenology of Alfred Schutz as a framework. From January to April 2011, nine mothers from the 2009 program "Chile Grows with You" were interviewed at health centers in an urban Santiago de Chile community. RESULTS: analysis of the "lived type" led to an understanding of the mothers' real-world experience. Unexpected pregnancies in extremely vulnerable mothers are associated with feelings of hopelessness then resignation. There is no plan for the future; the mother lives in the present with great uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: from the mothers' stories, significant patterns were identified in their experiences, yielding insights into society from these women's perspectives. For humanized, comprehensive nursing care, this expertise directs interventions designed to overcome despair in women excluded because of their invisibility and poverty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Threatened premature labor (TPL) is a severe obstetric complication which affects the mental and physical health of both the mother and fetus. Family resilience may have protective role against psychological distress in women experiencing these pregnancy complications. There may be resilience related risk factors in TPL women, and interplays may exist among psychological variables and within couples. This study aims to examine psychological outcomes influenced by different levels of resilience, and explore psychological interactions in TPL women, spouses, and between women and spouses. METHODS: Six validated questionnaires were used to measure the psychological outcomes (Connor-Davidson resilience scale CD-RISC, Edinburgh postnatal depression scale EPDS, positive and negative affect scale PANAS, pregnancy pressure scale PPS, simplified coping style questionnaire SCSQ, social support rating scale SSRS) in 126 TPL women hospitalized in three tertiary hospitals and 104 spouses in Southwest China. RESULTS: Low resilient women had significantly more complicated placenta praevia, longer pediatric observation, more pressure than high resilient women. They also had significantly less active coping and positive affect, more negative affect and depression compared to high resilient women and their spouses. Although the socio-demographic characteristics of both TPL women and spouses and psychometric parameters of spouses had no significant differences, the prevalence rates of depression in spouses were notable. Compared with spouses, TPL women had a more complex interaction among these psychometric factors, with women's resilience negatively associated with their partners' negative affect, and their pressure positively correlated with pressure and negative affect of spouses. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy complicated with placenta praevia and pediatric observation may be risk factors for resilience of women with TPL. Maternal resilience has an important impact on the psychological outcomes in TPL women. A screening for resilience, depression and other psychological outcomes in couples with TPL and early psychological intervention of low resilient couples may be appropriate to promote resilience and well-being of these families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The demography of Botswana is rapidly changing. Successes in tackling communicable diseases and economic development increased life expectancy from 53.7 years in 2006 to 66.8 years in 2016. The prevalence of diseases associated with older age, especially chronic non-communicable diseases including diabetes, hypertension and cerebrovascular disease are suspected to have increased but accurate data are lacking. The country has high youth unemployment and national retirement is at the age of 60, which limits the opportunity to build pensions for prosperity in older age. Changes across health, social care and economic policy are needed to prepare for a future ageing population. METHODS: This article reports on the national working group meeting outputs on issues that face older people, their families, healthcare providers, and policy makers in Botswana. A collaborative working group meeting was convened in Gaborone, Botswana on 25th September 2018 by the University of Botswana and University of Birmingham, UK, to identify key challenges and opportunities for an ageing Batswana population. RESULTS: There was agreement across diverse stakeholders of a need for effective and rapid policy formation to prepare and protect the future health and economy of an ageing Batswana population with a high burden of NCDs. The main priorities for policy-makers must be social care, poverty reduction and healthcare provision, conducted in an evidence-based manner, as far as practicable. To effectively achieve this, research and high-quality data collection mechanisms are required. CONCLUSIONS: Future policy in Botswana must focus on the challenges that an ageing population brings, and development of health and care system resilience for the demographic change could be a model for healthcare policy across Southern Africa.

AB  - Little is known about female sex workers' daily lives or emotional relationships. Using relational-cultural theory, this study explored the relationship dynamics between sex workers and their intimate partners in Kumasi, Ghana. We collected qualitative data from 37 male intimate partners through 24 in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions (FGDs) with 13 male partners. We also conducted three FGDs with 20 women involved in sex work. Relationships between sex workers and their intimate partners were mutual, reciprocal and transactional. Male partners provided protection for financial support, a place to sleep and intimacy. Both men and women described their relationships in terms of friendship, love and a hopeful future. Women were reluctant to quit sex work because they depended on it for income. Most respondents did not use condoms in these romantic relationships, citing trust, love, faithfulness and commitment. Both men and women described high levels of violence in their relationships. The context of sex work heightens vulnerability but also appears to facilitate resilience and creative coping strategies. The relational dynamics between sex workers and their intimate partners in Ghana merit further exploration to examine the extent to which women involved in sex work hold and exert power within these relationships.

AB  - Urban displacement is frequently portrayed as a new and unfamiliar dilemma for the humanitarian sector, yet broad awareness of its characteristics and challenges has been developing since the 1970s. In the past decade, however, there has been greater attention to, and recognition of, the implications of rapid urbanisation in the developing world. This has led to some policy development and a mounting body of NGO (non-governmental organisation) and think-tank literature on the topic. Assuming displacement to be a key lens on urban vulnerability more broadly, this paper presents an overview of the historical development of debates on urban displacement since the 1970s. Drawing examples from the contributions in this special issue of Disasters, as well as from other sources of information on recent humanitarian responses in various contexts, it assesses the ramifications of urban vulnerability for humanitarian practitioners. The paper contends that the humanitarian sector has failed to galvanise on the issue, and has struggled therefore to employ existing knowledge and to adapt practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Outpatients attending consultations at public hospitals may have unmet needs for preventive medical care. This study aimed to identify and assess the association between these needs, social vulnerability and mode of healthcare use. METHODS: In a multicentre epidemiological study, a group of socially vulnerable outpatients, was compared with a non-vulnerable group in a sample of 1316 outpatients selected in hospital consultations, using a validated tool for detection of social vulnerability. Before the patient was seen by medical staff, investigators collected data on social characteristics, healthcare use and preventive medical care received (interventions, advice). RESULTS: More than 75% of outpatients stated that they were regularly followed by a physician, usually a general practitioner, but fewer vulnerable than non-vulnerable outpatients were followed (77% vs. 89%, P < 10(-3)). For the majority of preventive interventions (vaccinations, screening for cardiovascular risk factors, gynaecological cancers), vulnerable outpatients presented a more marked shortage than non-vulnerable patients, but there was an overall shortage in both groups. When recommended preventive interventions had not been delivered, they had rarely been offered in either group. After adjustment for mode of healthcare use, the differences in preventive care received persisted to the disadvantage of vulnerable outpatients with regard to technical preventive interventions, but there was no difference between the two groups regarding advice received to reduce risk behaviours. CONCLUSION: Unmet needs for preventive care primarily resulted from social inequalities in secondary access to such care. It may be necessary to set up specific interventions targeting vulnerable patients within hospital consultations.

AB  - This paper studies the uninsured as a vulnerable population. We contend that reducing the size of the uninsured population yields important spillover benefits to the insured population, benefits that go beyond a lower charity care burden. Evidence presented in this paper reinforces studies in the literature that show that problems of health services quality and access facing insured people increase when the proportion of uninsured people in their local communities is greater. The size of such spillover benefits is reduced if the local market is large enough to be segmented based on insurance status.

AB  - This study explores multiple relational contexts that promote vulnerability and protection against early pregnancy in a potential risk group of Portuguese adolescents. A comparative analysis was made between two groups of female adolescents of low socioeconomic status: pregnant adolescents (n=57) and adolescents without a history of pregnancy (n=81). Results suggest that several variables belonging to different contexts-family and school and peer relations--are important in the characterization of the two groups. Lower levels of mother's overprotection and father's emotional support, presence of early pregnancy in adolescent's mother, lower level of emotional proximity to peer relations, and higher number of school failures are significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy.

AB  - Health care restructuring, in an effort to control costs, has resulted in marked organizational change with concomitant influences on nursing practice in the hospital and community contexts. Such changes have resulted in increased levels of acuity among patients and shorter hospital stays. As a consequence, families are being asked to assume greater roles in illness care of family members. At the same time societies and therefore patient populations are becoming increasingly culturally and linguistically diverse. Yet, little is known about hospitalization and help-seeking practices of family caregivers in an ethnoculturally diverse context and the nature of support they require from the health care system. This paper addresses this gap in knowledge. Here we draw upon data gathered in two ethnographic studies of illness care and help-seeking practices in an enthoculturally diverse community. Analysis of family data identified 'resisting vulnerability' as a process central to the families' experiences. This paper examines the process of resisting vulnerability and how it was influenced by the practices of health care professionals and structures of the health system. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Tanzania, teenage pregnancy rates are still high despite the efforts being made to reduce them. Not enough is known about how adolescents experience and cope with sexuality and teenage pregnancy. Over the past few decades, most studies have focused on vulnerability and risk among youth. The concept of 'reproductive resilience' is a new way of looking at teenage pregnancy. It shifts the perspective from a deficit-based to a strength-based approach. The study presented here aimed to identify factors that could contribute to strengthening the reproductive resilience of girls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional cluster sampling approach, 750 female adolescents aged 15-19 years were interviewed about how they mobilize resources to avoid or deal with teenage pregnancy. The main focus of the study was to examine how social capital (relations with significant others), economic capital (command over economic resources), cultural capital (personal dispositions and habits), and symbolic capital (recognition and prestige) contribute to the development of adolescent competencies for avoiding or dealing with teenage pregnancy and childbirth. RESULTS: A cumulative competence scale was developed to assess reproductive resilience. The cumulative score was computed based on 10 competence indicators that refer to the re- and pro-active mobilization of resources. About half of the women who had never been pregnant fell into the category, 'high competence' (50.9%), meaning they could get the information and support needed to avoid pregnancies. Among pregnant women and young mothers, most were categorized as 'high competence' (70.5%) and stated that they know how to avoid or deal with health problems that might affect them or their babies, and could get the information and support required to do so. Cultural capital, in particular, contributed to the competence of never-pregnant girls [OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.06 to 3.07, p = 0.029], pregnant adolescents and young mothers [OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.15 to 9.60, p = 0.026]. CONCLUSIONS: The reproductive resilience framework provides new insights into the reproductive health realities of adolescent girls from a strength-based perspective. While acknowledging that teenage pregnancy has serious negative implications for many female adolescents, the findings presented here highlight the importance of considering girls' capacities to prevent or deal with teenage pregnancy.

AB  - Guadeloupe (French West Indies) is a part of French departments which has the large number of persons living with HIV/AIDS. A large part of them consists of foreign women, mainly native of Haiti. This article is based on an anthropological study conducted in 2009 among professionals of health, social and associative sectors taking care of persons living with HIV in Guadeloupe, and among 10 infected women, 6 of them are native of Haiti. Semi-directive and individual qualitative interviews were conducted with each of these persons. During their course of illness and migration, many women experienced one or several pregnancies. The analysis of their discourses and trajectories underlines the articulation of the multiple stakes - medical, social, political, emotional stakes - with which they are confronted.

AB  - This study investigated if the terms "families at risk", "poor families", "families of popular class" and "low income families" could be related to the concept of "families in social vulnerability", when used by family therapists. It was performed a documental survey on the proceedings of six Brazilian scientific conferences and of one international conference about family therapy that occurred in Brazil. A quantitative analysis was conducted in order to verify how often these terms were used. A qualitative analysis was also performed in order to identify their definition. From 1994 to 2006, there was an increase from nine to 21 works using the investigated terms. The bibliographic material showed that these different terms are complementary and generally related to families in social vulnerability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety and depression commonly co-occur during pregnancy and may increase risk of poor birth outcomes including preterm birth and low birth weight. Our understanding of rates, patterns, and predictors of comorbid anxiety and depression is hindered given the dearth of literature, particularly in low- and middle-income (LMI) countries. The aim of this study is (1) to explore the prevalence and patterns of comorbid antenatal anxiety and depressive symptoms in the mild-to-severe and moderate-to-severe categories among women in a LMI country like Pakistan and (2) to understand the risk factors for comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Using a prospective cohort design, a diverse sample of 300 pregnant women from four centers of Aga Khan Hospital for Women and Children in Pakistan were enrolled in the study. Comorbid anxiety and depression during pregnancy were high and numerous factors predicted increased likelihood of comorbidity, including: (1) High level of perceived stress at any time point, (2) having 3 or more previous children, and (3) having one or more adverse childhood experiences. These risks were increased if the husband was employed in the private sector. Early identification and treatment of mental health comorbidities may contribute to decreased adverse birth outcomes in LMI countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased adverse pregnancy outcomes related to psychiatric and psychosocial problems can be observed for urban areas when compared to national averages. We developed a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based self-report screening model that produces tailored intervention advices. After having adapted the model to local care pathways, we tested the reliability, validity and feasibility of the model in routine antenatal care. METHODS: Observational study among pregnant women in a Dutch urban area included women with a booking visit. Women answered questions posed by the PDA-tool while waiting for their appointment. If the tool suggested specific interventions (screen result), this was discussed during booking visit. A randomly selected subsample of participants completed the questionnaire again at a subsequent pregnancy check (retest). After the study was conducted, prenatal caregivers and assistants were interviewed for feasibility judgments. Psychometric and diagnostic performance of this approach was established. RESULTS: Response rate among invited pregnant women was 94% on weighted average (n=621). Internal reliability ranged 0.88-0.90, test-retest reliability ranged 0.64-1.00. Positive predictive value was 86% and negative predictive value was 97%. No interpractice psychometrical differences were observed. Migrant women more often received an intervention advice than native women (p<0.001). The approach was well accepted among prenatal caregivers for its time efficiency and patient-friendliness. CONCLUSION: Psychometric properties of our screen-and-advice tool were favorable under routine conditions, and the feasibility of this integral approach appeared good. The technical flexibility renders the model suitable for broader application. Local care pathways can easily be incorporated. We suggest implementation of this model in prenatal care in urbanized settings in order to make tailored mental healthcare broadly available.

AB  - To identify Psychopathology, Psychosocial problems and substance use (PPS) as predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes, two screen-and-advice instruments were developed: Mind2Care (M2C, self-report) and Rotterdam Reproductive Risk Reduction (R4U, professional's checklist). To decide on the best clinical approach of these risks, the performance of both instruments was compared. Observational study of 164 pregnant women who booked at two midwifery practices in Rotterdam. Women were consecutively screened with M2C and R4U. For referral to tailored care based on specific PPS risks, inter-test agreement of single risks was performed in terms of overall accuracy and positive accuracy (risk present according to both instruments). With univariate regression analysis we explored determinants of poor agreement (<90 %). For triage based on risk accumulation and for detecting women-at-risk for adverse birth outcomes, M2C and R4U sum scores were compared. Overall accuracy of single risks was high (mean 93 %). Positive accuracy was lower (mean 46 %) with poorest accuracy for current psychiatric symptoms. Educational level and ethnicity partly explained poor accuracy (p < 0.05). Overall low PPS prevalence decreased the statistical power. For triage, M2C and R4U sum scores were interchangeable from sum scores of five or more (difference <1 %). The probability of adverse birth outcomes similarly increased with risk accumulation for both instruments, identifying 55-75 % of women-at-risk. The self-report M2C and the professional's R4U checklist seem interchangeable for triage of women-at-risk for PPS or adverse birth outcomes. However, the instruments seem to provide complementary information if used as a guidance to tailored risk-specific care.

AB  - Well-being is a complex construct related to sociodemographic and cultural aspects that vary across cultures. Latin America is a region with high social inequalities among population groups, although this varies significantly depending on the country. This article proposes a model that seeks to establish the relationship between psychosocial variables, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction in a sample of Colombian older adults. The model explores associations between resilience, socioeconomic status, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being. A study with a sample of 617 Colombian older adults was conducted. A structural equation modeling technique was performed. The results showed a model in which life satisfaction is positively explained by psychological well-being and resilience, whereas psychological well-being is explained by a higher socio-economic status. The results contribute to the evidence about how well-being is determined by psychosocial and cultural factors. The evidence found represents novel information about older adults in Colombia.

AB  - Sociocultural and economic conditions interact with biological processes throughout the course of life determining vulnerability or resilience in old age. The scope of this study was to investigate relationships between social vulnerability (gender, age and income); individual vulnerability (comorbidities, signs and symptoms, functional ability, perceived social support and perceived health), and programmatic vulnerability (indices of dependence on the public health system, social vulnerability and access to health services) in a sample of individuals aged 65 and more. 688 elderly people were interviewed in a single data gathering session in their homes in 88 selected urban census sectors in Campinas. 470 of the interviewees were women, with more comorbidities and more signals and symptoms, though more socially engaged in AADL and IADL than men. Mean age was 72.28 +/- 5.41; mean family income = 4.72 +/- 5.28 minimum wages. The variables with most explanatory power over the joint variation of the data were access and use of health services, levels of social vulnerability and dependence on public healthcare services, and family income. Social conditions as well as family income coexist with individual vulnerability in old age.

AB  - The concept of vulnerability is an important one for nurses because of its implications for health. The experience of vulnerability creates stress and anxiety which affects physiological, psychological and social functioning. Although everyone is vulnerable at different times in his or her life, some individuals are more likely to develop health problems than others. Vulnerability is affected by personal factors as well as factors within the environment. Trends in society indicate that increasing numbers of vulnerable people will create additional demands on an already over-burdened health care system. Vulnerability is an area that requires much further research and application.

AB  - Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda, whose population is predominately Burundian, has registered a rapid rise in pregnancies among girls between 13 and 15 years. In Rwanda, pregnant girls are encouraged to remain in school as long as their health and the health of the child is not jeopardised. Yet this study found that the majority of pregnant teenagers and teen mothers in Mahama are not in school due to the stigma associated with teenage pregnancy. This paper describes how pregnant teenagers and teen mothers experience stigma in terms of solitude and isolation. I draw on Bourdieusian theories of capital to expand on the analysis of solitude, to highlight how teen mothers use this solitude or isolation to rebuild their self-esteem and the symbolic capital which they lose when they become pregnant. The study suggests that despite the existence of a policy guaranteeing certain rights to girls, closer attention should be paid to the contextual barriers that may hinder pregnant teenagers or teen mothers from exercising these rights.

AB  - Young people constitute a priority for sexual health research, policy and planning. Many studies, however, regard youth as a homogeneous group defined by developmental stages and their problems as inherent rather than factors resulting from structural vulnerability. Ethnographic data from this study provided strong evidence of the inappropriateness, in prevention interventions, of the concept of 'young people' as a group defined only by age and gender. When incorporating social resources and support into the analysis, specific segments of youth with diverse sexual practices and health seeking behaviours emerge. Thus, although most young people in urban areas show a similar level of HIV/STI knowledge, their exposure to risk varies according to their living conditions. Two population segments - "street guys" and "fast girls" - identified as vulnerable for sexual risk, are characterized. Both groups hang out on the streets, and most are involved in using alcohol and drugs, and/or practicing transactional sex. This study provided evidence for the need of various approaches according to level of poverty and social vulnerability in order to develop more effective HIV/AIDS and STI prevention programs to meet the needs of young men and women in low-income areas.

AB  - Homeless urbanites are a heterogeneous population with unique health and social service needs. The study examined situational, behavioral, health-related and resource indicators in terms of their direct impact on frailty, hypothesized as a latent variable. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), a model was tested with 150 homeless men and women, ages 40-73, from three homeless day center drop-in sites on Skid Row and one residential drug treatment (RDT) facility that works with homeless parolees and probationers. In bivariate analyses with the latent construct frailty, months homeless (p < 0.01), female gender (p < 0.05), education (p < 0.05), comorbid conditions (p < 0.001), nutrition (p < 0.001), resilience (p < 0.001), health care utilization (p < 0.01), and falls (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with frailty. In the final path model, significant predictors of frailty included educational attainment (p < 0.01), comorbid conditions (p < 0.001), nutrition (p < 0.001), resilience (p < 0.001), and falls (p < 0.01). These findings will serve as a foundation for future nurse-led, community-based initiatives that focus on key predictors of frailty among the homeless and the development of interventions.

AB  - Ubuntu is a complex concept, but at its simplest is "human-ness," the notion that individuals' well-being is intertwined with that of others in the community. This article examines how ubuntu's multiple meanings offer a potential tool for resilience in South Africa, both for arts organizations and for micro and small businesses. Artist Proof Studio offers a sustained working example of how creativity can make a contribution towards a more just society using a hybrid arts/business model. The arts are particularly important in South Africa for offering the space to address deep wounds, using artistic collaborations to contribute to resilience and wellbeing. Ubuntu can offer an alternative vision to financing micro and small business to the one currently proposed by international lending organizations that seek to import Western-style models of shareholder primacy, short-term profit, and privatization of public goods. Ubuntu allows for creative new approaches to business, encouraging hybrid models that are socially focused and economically sustainable. The arts have the potential for a significant role in conceiving of ubuntu as a tool for resilience of micro and small businesses and as a way of conceptualizing being human in the business context, helping to envision productive and sustainable activities that advance greater economic sustainability.

DESIGN: A mixed methods design was used, which included semistructured interviews (n = 32) and a questionnaire (n = 80) administered to members of the two ethnic groups. FINDINGS: Five main themes emerged: (a) lack of resources, (b) intentional mistreatment, (c) deprivations (d) losses suffered, and (e) dealing with deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The literature describes child vulnerability in terms of deprivation in an individual younger than 18 years. The following four issues were also identified as being of special local significance: (a) discrimination against handicapped, illegitimate, and foster children; (b) the child is viewed as a resource rather than an individual with rights, (c) unrelated fostering is unusual, and (d) few strategies are known to study participants. IMPLICATIONS: Community development and children's rights need attention, particularly for disabled and illegitimate children. The most vulnerable children can be identified using existing mechanisms, assistance may be channeled through the mother, and unrelated fostering and volunteer involvement can be encouraged.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that education and poverty act through distinct pathways to influence sexually transmitted infection (STI), few studies have examined the unique, independent associations of these socioeconomic vulnerabilities with sexual risk behaviors and STI among women. METHODS: From August to October 2013, women at an antenatal clinic in Gressier, Haiti, were interviewed and tested for chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis (N = 200). We measured low educational attainment as less than 9 years of schooling and currently living in poverty based on crowding, defined as more than 2 people sleeping in one room. We used logistic regression to estimate independent associations between each socioeconomic indicator and outcomes of sexual behaviors and STI. RESULTS: Approximately 29% of the sample had a current STI (chlamydia, 8.0%; gonorrhea, 3.0%; trichomoniasis, 20.5%), with 2.5% testing positive for more than 1 STI. Forty percent of the sample reported low educational attainment and 40% reported current poverty. Low educational attainment was associated with early risk behaviors, including twice the odds of earlier sexual debut (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI],: 1.14-3.84). Poverty was associated with reporting the current main sexual partner to be nonmonogamous (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.00-4.01) and current STI (AOR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.26-4.98). CONCLUSIONS: Education and poverty seem to independently influence STI behaviors and infection, with low education associated with early sexual risk and poverty associated with current risk and infection. Improving women's educational attainment may be important in improving risk awareness, thereby reducing risky sexual behaviors and preventing a trajectory of STI risk.

AB  - This article examines the social patterning of health, economic uncertainty, hegemonic masculinity, and vulnerability among men who live and work in a low-income sex work community in Kampala, Uganda. This problematises the notion that vulnerable communities are homogenous, in demographics, economic status, and risk. This article draws on ethnographic data collected in 2016, including semi-structured interviews and participant observation. This article uses a stratified risk framework to describe the central finding of this study, which is that men's experience in Kataba is characterised by a struggle to fulfil the provider role that constitutes a core aspect of their socially ascribed gender role. In a context of economic scarcity, men's lives are fraught with strain and this intersects with other forms of risk. Finally, by focusing on community vulnerability rather than individual risk, this work contributes to theories of gender and sex work, and informs HIV/AIDS praxis.

AB  - It has been widely reported that battered women report significant distress as a result of their abuse, but some do not experience serious sequelae and it has been theorized that the explanation for this is explained by the woman's resilience. It is widely accepted that social support and psychological disturbance is related to resilience. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship among resilience, psychological disturbance, and social support in battered Hispanic women. This study found that type of support and acculturation were significantly correlated to the level of resiliency and mood disturbance experienced by Hispanic battered women. © 2009 Springer Publishing Company.

AB  - While international guidelines are currently being drawn up about HIV and infant feeding practices, and national and regional guidelines are under discussion in South Africa, there have been remarkably few studies that have sought to elicit HIV-positive mothers' experiences of breastfeeding and of paediatric infection. There is an urgent need to document this 'grass roots' knowledge in different sites, and for this data to be used to inform policy development, and for advocacy and counselling purposes. This qualitative investigation reports on the experiences and decisions taken around breastfeeding by a peer support group of 13 HIV-positive mothers meeting at King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban. In this study, the particular focus of information-giving and decision-making as to breast or formula feed is concerned with the impact on individual HIV-positive women and their babies. The most significant finding is that at no stage during their pregnancy were any of these mothers given information about the risks of HIV transmission through breastmilk. The study data were elicited in an in-depth group discussion, and individual women were invited to re-enact their stories in a follow-up discussion for clarification purposes. The women also discussed how they dealt with problems surrounding confidentiality in cases where few have been able to disclose their status to the extended family. There have been renewed calls for further investment in counsellors, with an enhanced role for community activists as peer educators. While there are severe resource constraints and low morale among many overworked nurses, one of the general problems in hospital settings remains the vertical health paradigm. This does not accommodate women's experiences, preferences, social networks and lay knowledge, and inhibits many women from becoming full participants in decisions affecting their own and their family's health.

AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have demonstrated a strong association between minority race, low socioeconomic status (SES), and lack of potential access to care (e.g., no insurance coverage and no regular source of care) and poor receipt of health care services. Most studies have examined the independent effects of these risk factors for poor access, but more practical models are needed to account for the clustering of multiple risks. OBJECTIVE: To present a profile of risk factors for poor access based on income, insurance coverage, and having a regular source of care, and examine the association of the profiles with unmet health care needs due to cost. Relationships are examined by race/ethnicity. DESIGN: Analysis of 32,374 adults from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported unmet needs due to cost: missing/delaying needed medical care, and delaying obtaining prescriptions, mental health care, or dental care. RESULTS: Controlling for personal demographic and community factors, individuals who were low income, uninsured, and had no regular source of care were more likely to miss or delay needed health care services due to cost. After controlling for these risk factors, whites were more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to report unmet needs. When presented as a risk profile, a clear gradient existed in the likelihood of having an unmet need according to the number of risk factors, regardless of racial/ethnic group. CONCLUSION: Unmet health care needs due to cost increased with higher risk profiles for each racial and ethnic group. Without attention to these co-occurring risk factors for poor access, it is unlikely that substantial reductions in disparities will be made in assuring access to needed health care services among vulnerable populations.

AB  - This article presents a mechanism for tracking and reporting health disparities data that are based on a general model of vulnerability. We briefly discuss the origins of this model and describe its focus on the cumulative impact of multiple risk factors on health-related outcomes. We then demonstrate how the model can be applied to inform the collection and reporting of health disparities data by providing three examples. Since national and state datasets contain information on a wide range of risk factors, researchers and policy makers would benefit from examining the multiple risks that affect vulnerable populations simultaneously, as we have demonstrated in the three examples. These examples suggest that the determinants of health and healthcare problems are multifactorial and that they can be studied in an integrative approach using risk profiles. This research methodology can strengthen our existing knowledge of health disparities and aid in the recognition of points of intervention to successfully improve health and healthcare for vulnerable populations.

AB  - This paper reviews work on resilience education in Hong Kong schools. The concept of resilience as defined in the Western literature is presented first, followed by a discussion of resilience from the Chinese perspective. The need for promoting resilience in school children and the effectiveness of the two most commonly used resilience-based programmes for current school children, Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programs and Healthy Promoting Schools, are reviewed. Suggestions for teachers and school counsellors for enhancing resilience further in school children are presented. Directions for educational researchers in refining the current prevention and intervention programmes on mental health are also highlighted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: the present descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study aimed to identify the vulnerability of families of elderly citizens cared for by the Family Health Strategy (FHS). METHOD: the research employed home interviews and was developed with a sample of 500 families of aged people cared for by 32 FHS teams in the city of Dourados, MS, Brazil. The Family Development Index (FDI) was adapted in order to classify the families according to their degree of vulnerability. RESULTS: the results revealed the presence of multigenerational families with low educational levels among individuals over the age of 20 and high illiteracy rates among elderly citizens. There were 403 families whose vulnerability was acceptable, 95 in severe vulnerability, and two families in a condition of very severe vulnerability. The most critical dimensions of the FDI were the access to knowledge and to work. CONCLUSION: the study identified that there is still a need for further investments that can assist these aged people and their families in the Primary Health Care.

AB  - New perspectives on vulnerability using emic and etic approaches The concept of vulnerability has not been developed theoretically from a nursing perspective. It has been viewed epidemiologically as population-based relative risk with little consideration of its experiential qualities. The purpose of this paper is to analyse critically the use of the term vulnerability using elements of concept clarification and a critical literature review. A new perspective of vulnerability is offered based on differentiating between the concepts of risk and experience. Risk consists of assumptions from etic or external evaluation of relative danger while lived experience informs an emic or personal interpretation. Assumptions related to the etic view include normative social values, objective harm and endangerment, and social sanction for intervention. An emic view of vulnerability is based on experiential perception of challenge to personal integrity and the universal and mutual nature of the phenomenon. Questions about the evaluation of harm, potential for growth, subjectivity and objectivity, social sanction and capacity for action, can help clarify the range between these two dimensions.

AB  - Out of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) derived from the Millennium Declaration, three (goals IV, V, and VI) were health related. High infant, under-five, and maternal mortality rates decreased in developing countries, but the rate was not satisfactory, because the preset targets were not achieved by 2015. The aim of this paper is to discuss whether the problems of neonatal health could be solved by the same approach as for the implementation of the MDGs or the paradigm should be changed. It is proposed to use Antonovsky's concept of salutogenesis, which is health oriented, meaning that it cares about conditions and mechanisms contributing to preserving health, opposing to pathogenesis aiming to investigate the pathogenesis of the disease with the semiology, symptoms, syndromes, and concepts of systemic, iatrogenic, or endogenous causes of disease. Besides that it is important to increase the resilience of mothers and neonates, understood as "the capacity, processes, or outcomes of successful adaptation in the context of significant threats to function or development." Implementing Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative of the World Health Organization and UNICEF in developing countries can preserve health of healthy mothers and healthy newborn infants by increasing their resilience.Copyright © The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines the concept of vulnerability in the context of maternal morbidity and mortality in Burkina Faso, an impoverished country in West Africa. Drawing on a longitudinal cohort study into the consequences of life-threatening or 'near miss' obstetric complications, we provide an in-depth case study of one woman's experience of such morbidity and its aftermath. We follow Kalizeta's trajectory from her near miss and the stillbirth of her child to her death from pregnancy-related hypertension after a subsequent delivery less than two years later, in order to examine the impact of severe and persistent illness and catastrophic health expenditure on her health and on her family's everyday life. Kalizeta's case illustrates how vulnerability in health emerges and is maintained or exacerbated over time. Even where social arrangements are supportive, structural impediments, including unaffordable and inadequate healthcare, can severely limit individual resilience to mitigate the negative social and economic consequences of ill health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Termination of pregnancy (TOP) remains a controversial issue, regardless of legislation. Access to services as well as psychological effects may vary across the world. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To better understand the psychological effects of TOP, this study describes the circumstances of 102 women who underwent a TOP from two socioeconomic sites in Johannesburg, South Africa, one serving women with few economic resources and the other serving women with adequate resources. The relationship between demographic characteristics, resilience and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression before, 1 month after and 3 months after the procedure was also examined. RESULTS: Time since TOP, age, chronic burden, resilience and the interaction of site with religion and site with chronic burden were significant. In addition, site differences were found for religion and chronic burden in predicting depression scores. Women from both sites had significant decreases in depression scores over time. The interaction of time with site was not significant. Higher chronic burden scores correlated with higher depression scores. No variables were significant in the bivariate analysis for PTSD. CONCLUSION: Resilience, religion and chronic burden emerge as significant variables in women undergoing a first-trimester TOP, and warrant further assessment in studies of this nature.

AB  - ZHENG's acupuncture school in Gansu,represented by ZHENG Yulin and ZHENG Kuishan,is of great influence in China. ZHENG's acupuncture school originated from Huangdi Neijing(Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor) and Nanjing(Classic of Questioning),and shaped around Yuan Dynasty and Ming Dynasty. Professor ZHENG Kuishan has formed a unique "ZHENG's acupuncture" diagnosis and treatment system by inheritance and innovation. He clinically paid attention to basic training,obtaining qi and keeping spirit,as well as syndrome differentiation,reinforcing and reducing. Also,he took the priority the pressing hand with bilaterally needle manipulation. Besides,he thought important simplicity,innovation and acupoints selecting according to time. We inherited ZHENG's acupuncture from his family,teachers'techniques,international communication,college and university education and scientific research. In this article we prescribe the development,the inheritance and the protection measures of ZHENG's acupuncture school in terms of its origination,academic thought,and inheritance research,etc.,so as to provide references for further study and inheritance.

AB  - Researchers need measures of vulnerability that are grounded in explicit theoretical and conceptual frameworks, that are sensitive to local contexts, and that are easy to collect. This paper presents the Index of Vulnerability (IoV), a quantitative yet anthropologically-informed method connecting social-ecological systems to mental and physical health outcomes. The IoV combines measures of five life domains; food insecurity, water insecurity, access to healthcare, social support, and social status. Scores on this index increase for each life domain where the individual falls into a "high risk" category. Thus, individuals with the highest IoV scores are those who are at risk across multiple life domains. This approach makes the IoV malleable to local contexts, as scholars can choose which measure of each life domain is most appropriate for their study population. An anthropological study conducted among 225 Awajun adults living in the Peruvian Amazon from March to November of 2013 showed that men with higher IoV scores had significantly lower summary fat skinfolds, lower triglyceride levels, and a greater probability of reporting moderate to severe somatic symptoms and poor perceived health. Awajun women with higher IoV scores had significantly elevated perceived stress levels and a greater probability of reporting poor perceived health and moderate to severe somatic and depressive symptoms. Importantly, comparing the IoV to its constituent parts shows that it predicts a wider range of mental and physical health outcomes than any of the life domains alone. The IoV is presented here in relation to the broader political-economic and cultural context of the Awajun, forwarding a critical biocultural approach within anthropology, and demonstrating the IoV's utility for other scholars and practitioners.

AB  - With principles of respect to the protection and implementation of human rights, cultural, ethnic and racial diversity and also the promotion of equity, the Stork Network ensures the right to reproductive planning and continued provision of care in maternal and child health. This study sought to evaluate the Active Ombudsman Survey of the Stork Network conducted with women who had their births assisted by the Unified Health System (SUS) in 2012, in order to analyze ethnic/racial differences in prenatal and childbirth care. This descriptive study used the secondary database from the survey conducted by the SUS Ombudsman. The universe of this investigation was constituted by 253,647 women, and 50.8% self-declared themselves as brown, 35.4% white, 10.6% black 2.1% yellow, 0.6% Indians and for 0.5% race/color was not informed. Women of black/brown race appear to be worse off in socioeconomic characteristics, prenatal and childbirth care, in all variables studied, except concerning aggression and supplementary payment. Knowledge about inequalities and vulnerability of this group may serve to alert society and the government, and as a guideline for the development of policies and actions to reduce health inequalities.

AB  - The population of sub-Saharan children and adolescents is substantial and growing. Even though most of this population is vulnerable, there is no comprehensive understanding of the social-ecological factors that could be leveraged by mental health practitioners to support their resilience. The present study undertakes a narrative scoping review of empirical research (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed) on the resilience of children and adolescents living in sub-Saharan Africa to determine what enables their resilience and what may be distinctive about African pathways of child and adolescent resilience. Online databases were used to identify full-text, peer-reviewed papers published 2000-2018, from which we selected 59 publications detailing the resilience of children and/or adolescents living in 18 sub-Saharan countries. Studies show that the resilience of sub-Saharan children and adolescents is a complex, social-ecological process supported by relational, personal, structural, cultural, and/or spiritual resilience-enablers, as well as disregard for values or practices that could constrain resilience. The results support two insights that have implications for how mental health practitioners facilitate the resilience of sub-Saharan children and adolescents: (i) relational and personal supports matter more-or-less equally; and (ii) the capacity for positive adjustment is complexly interwoven with African ways-of-being and -doing.

AB  - Structural adjustment programmes of international financial institutions have typically set the fiscal parameters within which health policies operate in developing countries. Yet, we currently lack a systematic understanding of the ways in which these programmes impact upon child and maternal health. The present article systematically reviews observational and quasi-experimental articles published from 2000 onward in electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar) and grey literature from websites of key organisations (IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank). Studies were considered eligible if they empirically assessed the aggregate effect of structural adjustment programmes on child or maternal health in developing countries. Of 1961 items yielded through database searches, reference lists and organisations' websites, 13 met the inclusion criteria. Our review finds that structural adjustment programmes have a detrimental impact on child and maternal health. In particular, these programmes undermine access to quality and affordable healthcare and adversely impact upon social determinants of health, such as income and food availability. The evidence suggests that a fundamental rethinking is required by international financial institutions if developing countries are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals on child and maternal health.

AB  - This paper presents findings on conditions of healthcare delivery in Afghanistan. There is an ongoing debate about barriers to healthcare in low-income as well as fragile states. In 2002, the Government of Afghanistan established a Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), contracting primary healthcare delivery to non-state providers. The priority was to give access to the most vulnerable groups: women, children, disabled persons, and the poorest households. In 2005, we conducted a nationwide survey, and using a logistic regression model, investigated provider choice. We also measured associations between perceived availability and usefulness of healthcare providers. Our results indicate that the implementation of the package has partially reached its goal: to target the most vulnerable. The pattern of use of healthcare provider suggests that disabled people, female-headed households, and poorest households visited health centres more often (during the year preceding the survey interview). But these vulnerable groups faced more difficulties while using health centres, hospitals as well as private providers and their out-of-pocket expenditure was higher than other groups. In the model of provider choice, time to travel reduces the likelihood for all Afghans of choosing health centres and hospitals. We situate these findings in the larger context of current debates regarding healthcare delivery for vulnerable populations in fragile state environments. The 'scaling-up process' is faced with several issues that jeopardize the objective of equitable access: cost of care, coverage of remote areas, and competition from profit-orientated providers. To overcome these structural barriers, we suggest reinforcing processes of transparency, accountability and participation.

AB  - Healthcare in the United States (US) is burdened with enormous healthcare disparities associated with a variety of factors including insurance status, income, and race. Highly vulnerable populations, classified as those with complex medical problems and/or social needs, are one of the fastest growing segments within the US. Over a decade ago, the US Surgeon General publically challenged the nation to realize the importance of oral health and its relationship to general health and well-being, yet oral health disparities continue to plague the US healthcare system. Interprofessional education and teamwork has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes and provide benefits to participating health professionals. We propose the implementation of interprofessional education and teamwork as a solution to meet the increasing oral and systemic healthcare demands of highly vulnerable US populations.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Infant mortality expresses a set of living, working and healthcare access conditions and opens up possibilities for adopting interventions to expand equity in healthcare. This study aimed to investigate vulnerability and the consequent differences in access to health services and occurrences of deaths among infants under one year of age in the municipality of Embu. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a descriptive study in the municipality of Embu. METHODS: Primary data were collected through interviews with the families of children living in the municipality of Embu who died in the years 1996 and 1997 before reaching one year of age. Secondary data were obtained from death certificates. The variables collected related to living conditions, income, occupation, prenatal care, delivery and the healthcare provided for children. These data were compared with the results obtained from a study carried out in 1996. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found with regard to income, working without a formal employment contract and access to private health plans among the families of the children who died. There were also differences in access to and quality of prenatal care, frequency of low birth weight and neonatal inter-ocurrences. CONCLUSIONS: The employment/unemployment situation was decisive in determining the degree of family stability and vulnerability to the occurrence of infant deaths, in addition to the conditions of access to and quality of healthcare services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The international nursing shortage has implications for the quality and safety of patient care. Various studies report that nurses do not have time to complete all necessary nursing care tasks, potentially resulting in nurse-perceived time pressure. Providing good care in the current nursing environment often poses a real ethical challenge for nurses. How nurses experience caring for cancer patients under time pressure and how they deal with the limited time available in achieving an ethical nursing practice remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To report qualitative research grounded in oncology nurses' experiences with time pressure, its perceived impact on nursing care and the ways in which they deal with it. DESIGN: A qualitative study design with a grounded theory approach was conducted to explore and explain oncology nurses' experiences with time pressure and its underlying dynamics. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Purposive and theoretical sampling led to the inclusion of 14 nurses with diverse characteristics from five inpatient oncology nursing wards in one academic hospital. METHODS: Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted over a six-month period in 2015 and 2016. Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. The interview data was analysed using the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven and NVivo software. RESULTS: The conceptualised phenomenon of time pressure, grounded in empirical data, illuminated its complexity and helped us to explicate and describe what nurses felt when working under time pressure. The interviewed nurses described time pressure as a shared yet nuanced reality. We uncovered that nurses dealt with time pressure in varied ways, with a broad range of proactive and 'ad hoc' strategies. According to our interviewees, time pressure was a significant barrier in providing good nursing care. They illustrated how time pressure particularly affected the interactional aspects of care, which most nurses considered as essential in an oncology setting. Underlying personal, cultural and context-related factors seemed to play a key role in nurses' individual experiences with time pressure. CONCLUSION: Time pressure is a widely recognised and experienced phenomenon among nurses which has substantial negative implications for the quality and safety of patient care. Our findings reinforce the need to establish better support for nurses and to reduce the circumstances in which nurses are ethically challenged to provide good care due to time pressure. Based on our findings, we recommend investing more in the nursing culture and nurses' personal development, in addition to optimising nurse staffing levels.

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine possible influences on individual differences in adolescence in response to early institutional care in infancy not involving either generalized privation or subnutrition. Fifty-two adopted adolescents aged 13 years who received institutional care in infancy at the Metera Babies Centre and 36 adolescents of the same age who were raised in their biological families participated in the study. Adolescents' attachment relationships, cognition, behavioral adjustment and use of psychological services were assessed. Marked heterogeneity in outcomes was found. No predictive effects were found for preinstitutional features or for adoptive circumstances. By contrast a large effect was found for institutional care extending beyond the age of 2 years and for quality of institutional care as experienced at an individual level. There was a close association between prolonged institutional care and disorganized attachment while in the institution, but the main institutional effect derived from the length of time in the institution.

AB  - This community-partnered study was developed and fielded in partnership with key community stakeholders and describes age- and race-related variation in delays in care and preventive service utilization between middle-aged and older adults living in South Los Angeles. The survey sample included adults aged 50 and older who self-identified as African American or Latino and lived in ZIP codes of South Los Angeles (N=708). Dependent variables were self-reported delays in care and use of preventive services. Insured participants aged 50 to 64 were more likely to report any delay in care (adjusted predicted percentage (APP)=18%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=14-23) and problems obtaining needed medical care (APP=15%, 95% CI=12-20) than those aged 65 and older. Uninsured participants aged 50 to 64 reported even greater delays in care (APP=45%, 95% CI=33-56) and problems obtaining needed medical (APP=33%, 95% CI=22-45) and specialty care (APP=26%, 95% CI=16-39) than those aged 65 and older. Participants aged 50 to 64 were generally less likely to receive preventive services, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and colonoscopy than older participants, but women were more likely to receive mammograms. Participants aged 50 to 64 had more problems obtaining recommended preventive care and faced more delays in care than those aged 65 and older, particularly if they were uninsured. Providing insurance coverage for this group may improve access to preventive care and promote wellness.

AB  - Using population-based and family structural data from a high HIV-prevalence district of Southern India, this paper considers four suggested social scenarios used to explain the positive correlation between HIV prevalence and previously married status among Indian women: (1) infection from and then bereavement of an infected husband; (2) abandonment after husbands learn of their wives' HIV status; (3) economic instability after becoming previously married, leading women to seek financial support through male partners; and (4) the social status of being previously married exposing women to sexual harassment and predation. By also considering seroprevalence of two other common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), herpes and syphilis, in a combined variable with HIV, we limit the likelihood of the first two scenarios accounting for the greater part of this correlation. Through a nuanced analysis of household residences patterns (family structure), standard of living, and education, we also limit the probability that scenario three explains a greater portion of the correlation. Scenario four emerges as the most likely explanation for this correlation, recognizing that other scenarios are also possible. Further, the interdisciplinary literature on the social position of previously married women in India strongly supports the suggestion that, as a population, previously married women are sexually vulnerable in India. Previously married status as an STI risk factor requires further biosocial research and warrants concentrated public health attention.

AB  - MK-801, as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibitor, causes elevation in glutamate release, which may lead to an increase in excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and, consequently, cell death. 1-Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) shows antioxidant activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with 1MeTIQ and MK-801 on cell viability, antioxidant enzyme activity, and glutamate release in the rat hippocampus. Cytotoxicity was measured using lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay (LDH) and the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay; antioxidant enzyme activity (glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)) were measured by ELISA kits. The release of glutamate in the rat hippocampus was measured using in vivo microdialysis methodology. An in vitro study showed that MK-801 induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner and that 1MeTIQ partially reduced this adverse effect of MK-801. An ex vivo study indicated that MK-801 produced an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity (GPx, GR, and SOD), whereas coadministration of MK-801 and 1MeTIQ restored the activity of these enzymes to the control level. An in vivo microdialysis study demonstrated that combined treatment with both drugs decreased the release of glutamate in the rat hippocampus. The above results revealed that 1MeTIQ shows limited neuroprotective activity under conditions of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - From a child-focused lens, effective social protection requires an understanding of the sources of vulnerability faced by children, and appropriate responses. One of the useful aspects of the increased prominence of cash transfers in the social protection debate has been to highlight the fact that for many children living in developing countries, economic poverty is a major driver of children's vulnerability and deprivation. However, without taking away from the crucial role of cash transfers, it is also clear that cash alone may not always be the optimum response to children and families' vulnerability. Social welfare services have an important role to play within social protection, but within developing countries this greater role faces two key challenges: weak social welfare services provision and the challenges of incorporating this into the already demanding social protection policy agenda. These challenges point to a number of questions requiring further research and learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper reviews approaches to vulnerability in public health, introducing a series of 10 papers addressing vulnerability in health in Africa. We understand vulnerability as simultaneously a condition and a process. Social inequalities are manifest in and exacerbate three key dimensions of vulnerability: the initial level of wellbeing, the degree of exposure to risk, and the capacity to manage risk effectively. We stress the dynamic interactions linking material and social deprivation, poverty, powerlessness and ill health: risks or shocks and their health impacts are intimately interconnected and reinforce each other in a cycle which in the absence of effective interventions, increases vulnerability. An inductive process which does not begin with an a priori definition or measurement of 'vulnerability' and which does not assume the existence of fixed 'vulnerable groups' allowed us both to re-affirm core aspects of existing conceptual frameworks, and to engage in new ways with literature specifically addressing vulnerability and resilience at the population level as well as with literature - for example in ecology, and on the concept of frailty in research on aging - with which researchers on health and poverty in Africa may not be familiar. We invite conceptual and empirical work on vulnerability in complex systems frameworks. These perspectives emphasize contexts and nonlinear causality thus supporting analyses of vulnerability and resilience as both markers and emergent properties of dynamic interactions. We accept a working definition of vulnerability, and recognize that some definable groups of people are more likely than others to suffer harm from exposure to health risks. But we suggest that the real work - at both intellectual and policy/political levels - lies in understanding and responding to the dynamics, meanings and power relations underlying actual instances and processes of vulnerability and harm.
