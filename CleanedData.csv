Primary end point(s): Safety: Number of vaccine attributable events. Immunogenicity: Frequencies and magnitudes of serum IgA and IgG antibody responses to LTB and/or O78 LPS following immunization.Diagnostic Tools: To set the optimal threshold limits of the two quantitative PCR procedures by setting limits for the number of amplification cycles (Cq values) which best allows (in terms of sensitivity  specificity  and positive predictive value) for identification of moderate or severe ETEC TD cases  as well as cases associated with other enteric pathogens using the culture based antigen detection methods as the ÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬ÃÂGold-standardÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬ÃÂ for comparison.
