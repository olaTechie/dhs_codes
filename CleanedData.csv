All AEFI will be graded using a severity scale (0 - none   1 - mild   2 - moderate   3- severe   4 - very severe   5 - fatal)  and analysis will be stratified by severity and age group (6 weeks to 11 months old  12 to 23 months old  24 to 59 months old  5 to 14 years old).  within 7 days of receipt of each vaccine dose|Number and proportion of vaccination recipients who experience solicited or unsolicited severe adverse events (SAE) following vaccination  The outcome is determined at the individual level. SAE are defined as any AEFI with severity \>= 3. Outcome ascertainment will occur through (i) in-person monitoring of vaccine recipients for 30 min after vaccine administration  (ii) exhaustive follow-up of all vaccine recipients 7 days after vaccination  with administration of a structured questionnaire to their parents or caregivers   (iii) availability of a 24/7 phone number which caregivers of vaccine recipients will be encouraged to contact   (iv) visits to the camp's single primary healthcare facility  during each day on which vaccination takes place  to identify any children presenting for care with a SAE   and (v) availability of a 24/7 phone number which clinicians at the primary healthcare facility will be encouraged to contact. Each SAE will be followed up until resolution. Relatedness of each SAE to vaccine receipt will be classified as 'unrelated'  'unlikely'  'possible'  'probable'  'definite' and 'not assessable'.  within 7 days of receipt of each vaccine dose,Safety,1500.0,Both Genders,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not_Yet_Recruiting,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,Academic,Save the Children|Murdoch Children's Research Institute|Ministry of Health Development  Somaliland,NGOs,1.0,Large
